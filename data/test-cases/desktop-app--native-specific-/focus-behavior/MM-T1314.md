**Step 1**

1. Mattermost > Sign in to Another Server to open Add Server modal

2. Focus text input

3. Use keyboard shortcuts to switch to another application

   - **Windows:** Alt + Tab, hold Alt and press Tab until you reach the application you want to switch to
   - **Mac:** Cmd + Tab

4. Use keyboard shortcuts to return back to Mattermost desktop app

**Expected**

Previously focused text input is still focused when returning to application
