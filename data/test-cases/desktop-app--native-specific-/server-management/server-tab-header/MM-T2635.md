**Step 1**

Open Mattermost Desktop and make sure you have a server added

---

**Step 2**

Drag and drop the first tab to the right of the second tab.

**Expected**

The first tab should now appear after the second tab.

---

**Step 3**

Restart the application, OR open config.json and check the order

**Expected**

The order of the tabs should be preserved.
