### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Open Mattermost Desktop, and make sure you have at least 2 servers listed in the dropdown.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Initial order of server should be the order in which the servers were added.</article>

<hr/>

**Step 2**

> <article>Drag the first server down below the second one. Then open/close the dropdown.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>The second server should now appear above the first one before closing the dropdown and should persist in that order after re-opening.<br /><br /></article>

<hr/>

**Step 3**

> <article>Close and re-open Mattermost OR open the config.json file.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Server tab order is preserved after restart and/or persisted on disk.</article>
