## MM-T2925: Trust protocols, auto-converting protocols to links and capturing unhandled exceptions

---

**Step 1**

Trust protocol question:

1. ensure you don't have spotify in your `<configpath>/Mattermost/allowedProtocols.json` or dont have that file 
2. post a link with spotify protocol like:\
   `[herbie hanckock](spotify:album:5fmIolILp5NAtNYiRPjhzA)`
3. Click on the link

**Expected**

- Dialog should appear. 

  - if hitting No, dialog closes, file does not open
  - if hitting yes it won't save the new protocol, but still open on spotify
  - if hitting save it will add an entry to the above file

- if user chose save, the file must contain the entry and clicking again on the posted link should not raise the dialog again.

---

**Step 2**

Additional default protocols:

1. Post the following\
   \
   \[email]\(mailto:someone\@example.com) \[http]\(http\://mattermost.com) \[https]\(https\://mattermost.com) \[ftp]\(http\://ftp.hosteurope.de/mirror/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/) \[tel]\(tel:+12025550168)
2. Click on each link

Note:\
\[spotify]\(spotify:track:4Lvsivg09vKPfUpxpF3zcz) should still ask for permission to be trusted if not previously added to the trusted list

**Expected**

- Protocols are automatically converted to links and marked as safe
- Each clicked link should open the appropriate program and the desktop app shouldn't show a message about adding the protocol as trusted

---

**Step 3**

**N/A for now - We need to find a way to make the app crash in order to verify**\
Unhandled exceptions:\
Cause the app to crash and a dialog should appear offering user three choices:

- Ok 
- Show Details 
- Reopen 

**Expected**

- Ok - Dismisses the dialog, closes the app
- Show Details - window with info should appear, App closes
- Reopen - app should close and reopen
