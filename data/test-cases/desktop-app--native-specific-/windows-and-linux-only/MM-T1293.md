## MM-T1293: Flash taskbar icon — Windows & Linux ONLY

---

**Step 1**

1. Perform a fresh desktop app install
2. Navigate to settings:
   \
   **Windows**: File ➜ Settings (**CTRL+,**)\
   **Linux:** File ➜ Settings (**CTRL+,**)

**Expected**

- Verify "Flash taskbar icon when a new message is received If enabled, the taskbar icon will flash for a few seconds when a new message is received." should be selected/checked on new installs by default.

---

**Step 2**

1. Go to \[channel1] and set channel "Notification Preferences > Send desktop notifications" to "Only for mentions"
2. As a different user post on \[channel1]

**Expected**

- No desktop notification sent, taskbar icon doesn't flash.

---

**Step 3**

1. Go to \[channel2] and set channel "Notification Preferences ➜ Send desktop notifications" to "For all activity"
2. Use another test account on a web browser to send a message in \[channel1] and \[channel2] without mentioning the user.
