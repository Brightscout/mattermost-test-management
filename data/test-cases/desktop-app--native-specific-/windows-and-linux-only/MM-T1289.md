[Linux Desktop app — Start on login starts app as a blank window — MM-26832](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26832)

**Expected**

After 1) setting is auto-saved\
After 2) Desktop app starts automatically with the window open visibly on the screen. User can then chose to minimize (with the -) to the taskbar or close (with the x) meaning it gets minimized to the system tray
