## MM-T1661: Desktop notifications

**Step 1**

1. Receive direct mention, thread reply (if enabled for mentions) or DM from a different user

  "_This is coming from the OS and we are not able to fix on our end._"

**Step 2**

1. Observe the server tab, sidebar channel (LHS) and desktop  notification

**Expected**

- Desktop notification, channel mention and tab mention count update at the same time when notification is received.
