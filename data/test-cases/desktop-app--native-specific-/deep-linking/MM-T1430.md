### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"><li>Configure the Desktop app to have both of the following servers:<ul><li>https://community-daily.mattermost.com/</li><li>https://community.mattermost.com/</li></ul></li><li>Copy a permalink from a post on community.mattermost.com</li><li>Post it on a channel (public or private) on community-daily.mattermost.com<br>Or vice versa, it's really up to you. üòè</li><li>Click the automatically created '&lt;jump to convo&gt;' link</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>You're taken to the post as it exists on the server you clicked it on.<br>(e.g., the link was originally for community-daily and when you clicked it on community it just opened the link <em>in community</em> instead of switching tabs)<br><br><strong>Note</strong>: The reason this works is when the link you pasted was converted to '&lt;jump to convo&gt;' it recognized the deeplink and changed the server to match because it's smarter than you and wanted to make it easy on everyone.</article>

<hr/>

**Step 2**

> <article><ol><li>Post the permalink you created above in step 1A as a markdown link (e.g., [text](permalink) )</li><li>Click the link</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>This time it switches to the appropriate server tab as it's not as smart as it thought it was when creating the '&lt;jump to convo&gt;' link above. üòõ<br><br>But most important it doesn't open up the link in a browser which was the point of the bug linked below. Unless of course you missed step 1A above which means you might want to run through all of this again. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</article>
