## MM-T1304: Open desktop app from prompt after opening channel URL

---

**Step 1**

1. Sign in to <https://community.mattermost.com> on your desktop app, and join the Developers channel
2. Quit the desktop app
3. On your browser, enter [mattermost://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers](http://mattermost%3A//community.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers) in the URL and hit Enter
4. Select "Open Mattermost" in the resulting pop up

**Expected**

- Desktop app launches, and opens the Developers channel.

\
**Notes**:

- If you have multiple versions of the desktop app it may try to open in one of the versions you're not expecting it to (I think it chooses the first one in the list)
- Added this test during 4.2.1 testing because Custom URL Schemes setting has caused the existing deep linking tests to stop working (JB filed N/A until <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14661> is done)
