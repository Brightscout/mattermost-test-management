## MM-T4049: Use app in tiled and full screen position

---

**Step 1**

_Use app in tiled position_\\

1. Start the app
2. Drag app to side of the screen or select option to tile to left or right side of the screen
3. Tile another app on the opposite side
4. Move few server tabs
5. Open Settings and close
6. Open Console and close

**Expected**

- App should remain tiled
- Moving tabs and opening other windows should not impact app's tiled positioning

2. Expand the app to full screen (do not use double-click on top bar)
3. Move few server tabs
4. Open Settings and close
5. Open Console and close

**Expected**
