**Step 1**

1. Connect the desktop app to a server that has Image Proxying disabled.

2. Post the following message to a chat:\
   **\[evil-link]\(hello,world:,/../../..//api/v4/image?url=https\://google.com)**

3. Click on the link

   1. The link opens in the default browser window

**Expected**

- The link redirects to an untrusted origin, so it should open in the user's default browser.
