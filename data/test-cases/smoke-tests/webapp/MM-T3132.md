## MM-T3132: Leave team by clicking Yes, leave all teams

---

**Step 1**

Leave team by clicking Yes, leave all teams\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Note**: Before you leave a team, know that you will **NOT** be automatically added back to channels if you re-join. And you'll need invitations back to private channels.\
\
So make sure you're using a test account that doesn't matter. Can create new separate test account to test this on, and have that account join multiple teams before leaving them all\
\
1\. Click main menu ➜ Leave Team\
2\. Click Yes\
3\. Repeat until no more teams

**Expected**

- User sees list of teams available to join if there are any (and/or Create a Team, depending on permissions)
