## MM-T3060: Channel shortlinking - ~ autocomplete

---

**Step 1**

Channel shortlinking - \~ autocomplete\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Type "\~" followed by part of a PUBLIC channel handle\
2\. Select an autocomplete result.\
3\. Press enter and send the message.\
4\. Click on the channel link.

**Expected**

Autocomplete properly filters after 1. After 3, the sent message should have the channel link with the channel name (hyperlinked correctly)\
\
\~channel autocomplete shouldn't flicker as you type in step 1.
