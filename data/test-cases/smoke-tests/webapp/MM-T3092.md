With a &quot;Member&quot; (non-admin) account, join at least two teams<br />2.

On that now-private team, go to Main Menu &gt; Manage Members<br />3. Copy the URL for that team (not an invite; just the URL)<br />4. Click &quot;Remove user from team&quot; next to the Member from step one<br />5. Log out<br />6. Log in to the server with the removed member's credentials<br />7.

**Expected**
