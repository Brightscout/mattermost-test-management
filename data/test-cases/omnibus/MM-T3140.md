## MM-T3140: Package update

---

**Step 1**

Package update\
————————————————————————————\
In a new server

1. Run the "curl -o- <https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/repo-setup.sh> | sudo bash"
2. Run "sudo apt list -a mattermost-omnibus" to see list of available versions
3. Run "apt install mattermost-omnibus=PREVIOUS\_VERSION mattermost=PREVIOUS\_VERSION", where PREVIOUS\_VERSION is the prior version to the one currently under testing (e.g.: "apt install mattermost-omnibus=5.27.0-0 mattermost=5.27.0-0")

**Expected**

- The server URL should be accessible

---

**Step 2**

1. Register a user and post a couple of messages with an attachment into the Town Square channel
2. Check the "About Mattermost" menu option and ensure that the version number is the correct one. Close the modal dialog and don't close the Mattermost tab
3. Run "apt install mattermost-omnibus=CURRENT\_VERSION mattermost=CURRENT\_VERSION", where CURRENT\_VERSION corresponds to the version under testing, (e.g. "apt install mattermost-omnibus=5.28.1-0 mattermost=5.28.1-0")

**Expected**

- The update process should not ask for any information and it should finish correctly. A banner indicating that Mattermost has been updated should appear in the web client

---

**Step 3**

1. In the previously opened tab, a banner should appear after 10-15 seconds indicating that Mattermost has been updated. Click on the link to reload

**Expected**

- Mattermost should reload successfully

---

**Step 4**

1. Check the "About Mattermost" menu option

**Expected**

- The About Mattermost modal should have the updated Mattermost version
