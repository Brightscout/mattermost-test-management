**Step 1**

1. Run the `/msteams-sync promote <MM_username> <new_username>` command in any channel or DM/GM by the system admin account.

**Step 2**

1. The user to be promoted(whose MM username will be provided) should be already promoted.
2. Run the `/msteams-sync promote <MM_username> <new_username>` command in any channel or DM/GM by the system admin account.

**Expected**

The user should be promoted to a normal user with the new assigned username. On step 2, the user should be returned an error message that the desired user was not found.
