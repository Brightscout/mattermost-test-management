## MM-T1967: Error banner does not overlap / conflict with Marketplace text

---

**Step 1**

Error banner does not overlap / conflict with Marketplace text\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Set up an invalid Marketplace URL.\
2\. Launch Marketplace modal.\
3\. Verify that there is an error banner on the top of the modal indicating there is a connection error.\
4\. Scroll down on the modal

**Expected**

Error banner should not transparently overlap the text in the Marketplace modal so that it is difficult to read the texts.
