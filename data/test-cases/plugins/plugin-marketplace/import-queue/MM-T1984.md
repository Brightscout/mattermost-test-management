## MM-T1984: Plugin can be overwritten from Plugin Marketplace

---

**Step 1**

Plugin can be overwritten from Plugin Marketplace\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Launch Plugin Marketplace in 2 separate browser tabs.\
2\. Install Demo plugin from the 1st tab.\
3\. Wait for plugin to install.\
4\. On a third tab, go to System Console > Plugin Management.\
5\. Remove Demo plugin.\
6\. Install Zoom plugin v1.0.5 by uploading the tar.gz file.\
7\. Ensure that the plugin is installed.\
8\. Go to the 2nd tab (the “Install” button for the installed plugin in step 2 should still say “Install” and not “Configure”).\
9\. Click on “Install” for Zoom plugin.\
10\. When the overwrite confirmation modal pops up, click on Overwrite.

**Expected**

Demo plugin v1.0.7 (or the latest available) is installed
