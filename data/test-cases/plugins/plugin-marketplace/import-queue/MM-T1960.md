## MM-T1960: Marketplace is available when “Enable Plugins” is true in the admin console page

---

**Step 1**

Marketplace is available when “Enable Plugins” is true\
————————————————————————————

1. Go to main menu > System Console > PLUGINS > Plugin Management.
2. Set “Enable Plugins” to true.
3. Switch to a MM team.
4. Go to main menu.
5. Click on “Plugins Marketplace”.

_Important notes about this step:_

This test is to verify the UI component in the System Console's "Plugin Management" page instead of changing the plugin settings through the server config file.

**Expected**

After #4,\\

- “Plugins Marketplace” is available in the menu.

After #5,\\

- Plugins Marketplace launches normally.
