## MM-T3559: Autolink does not modify posts made by Bot accounts by default

---

**Step 1**

1\. Add an autolink pattern such as LHS that would edit the text `LHS`(see test data)\
2\. As a bot, make a post that contains text "LHS"

**Test Data**

```
"Pattern": "(LHS)","Template": "[LHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#lhs)",
```

**Expected**

Autolink formatting is not applied to bot posts

---

**Step 2**

1\. Enable Process Bot Posts ex: `/autolink set lhs ProcessBotPosts true`\
2\. As a bot, make a post that contains text "LHS"

_Important notes about this step:_

For 2. - You can use something such as `curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"channel_id":"&lt;&gt;", "message":"This is a message matching LHS pattern from a bot with mention for @dkh-sysadmin and @dkh-member", "props":{}}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer &lt;&gt;' https://&lt;&gt;/api/v4/posts`

**Test Data**

```
"Pattern": "(LHS)","Template": "[LHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#lhs)",
```

**Expected**

Autolink formatting is now applied to bot posts
