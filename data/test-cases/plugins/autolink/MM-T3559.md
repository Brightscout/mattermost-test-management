## MM-T3559: Autolink does not modify posts made by Bot accounts by default

---

**Step 1**

1\. Add an autolink pattern such as LHS that would edit the text \`LHS\`(see test data)\
2\. As a bot, make a post that contains text "LHS"

**Test Data**

```
"Pattern": "(LHS)",
"Template": "[LHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#lhs)",
```

**Expected**

Autolink formatting is not applied to bot posts

---

**Step 2**

1\. Enable Process Bot Posts ex: \`/autolink set lhs ProcessBotPosts true\`\
2\. As a bot, make a post that contains text "LHS"

**Test Data**

```
"Pattern": "(LHS)",
"Template": "[LHS](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#lhs)",
```

**Expected**

Autolink formatting is now applied to bot posts
