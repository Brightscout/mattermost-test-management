## MM-T4524: Create Modal Validation - Handle Server side error when an issue cannot be created due to fields being unavailable

---

**Step 1**

1\. Miconfigure Jira such that a mandatory field is not visible when trying to create an issue (Mandatory in field configuration but missing from "screen" needed)\
2\. Test in the UI that the issue cannot be created\
3\. Attempt to create an issue in the same project using the Jira plugin

**Expected**

Modal closes with and an ephermal post shows\
"This plugin did not receive all the required fields from your Jira project and could not complete the request. Please create your Jira issue manually or contact your Jira administrator"
