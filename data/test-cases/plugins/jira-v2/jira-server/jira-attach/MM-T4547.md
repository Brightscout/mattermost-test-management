### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Ensure that attachment size limit is enabled and set to the default 10 MB<br />2. Make a post in Mattermost that contains a file attachment larger than 10 MB<br />3. Open the post menu and select attach to Jira<br />4. In the attach modal that opens, search for and select a Jira issue<br />5. Attach the comment to the issue<br />6. Open the Jira issue in a browser (can click the link posted after 4.)</article>

**Expected**

> <article>On 4. the Jira plugin sends you a DM informing you that the attachment was not made as the size limit was exceeded<br />On 5. the comment created via Mattermost post is visible in Jira without the file attachment</article>
