## MM-T4497: Jira Unassign respects permissions

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login and connect as a user that only has browse permissions and does not have access to assign or unassign issues\
2\. Type "/jira unassign < Jira issue key >" For an issue in the target project that has an assignee

**Expected**

When user does not have permission to assign users unassign does not work
