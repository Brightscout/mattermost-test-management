## MM-T3322: Verify no '--instance' needed for slash commands when only one instance is connected

---

**Step 1 from MM-T3321: A second Jira instance can be installed**

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: The following step/s in Step 1 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T3321 test case. -->

_**Step 1.1**_

1\. Install the Jira plugin\
2\. Install one instance of Jira on your Mattermost server\
3\. Connect your test user

_**Expected**_

A single jia instance is installed and connected

_**Step 1.2**_

1\. Use the slash command to install a 2nd Jira instance ex: /jira instance install cloud [https://mmtest.atlassian.net](https://mmtest.atlassian.net/)\
2\. Complete the installation by adding an application on the Jira side\
3\. Connect the test user to the 2nd Jira instance

_**Expected**_

A send instance of Jira has been successfully added

---

**Step 2**

1\. Ensure your test user is only connected to 1 instance of jira\
2\. Use any issue slash command without specifying an instance ex: /jira issue view EXT-122\
3\. Send the command without selecting your _--instance_ form the autocomplete

**Expected**

Slash command works without passing in an instance. Issue can be viewed.
