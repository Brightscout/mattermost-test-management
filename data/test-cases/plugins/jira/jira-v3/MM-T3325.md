## MM-T3325: Slash commands work with default instance when no '--instance' is provided

---

**Step 1 from MM-T3321: A second Jira instance can be installed**

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: The following step/s in Step 1 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T3321 test case. -->

_**Step 1.1**_

1\. Install the Jira plugin\
2\. Install one instance of Jira on your Mattermost server\
3\. Connect your test user

_**Expected**_

A single jia instance is installed and connected

_**Step 1.2**_

1\. Use the slash command to install a 2nd Jira instance ex: /jira instance install cloud [https://mmtest.atlassian.net](https://mmtest.atlassian.net/)\
2\. Complete the installation by adding an application on the Jira side\
3\. Connect the test user to the 2nd Jira instance

_**Expected**_

A send instance of Jira has been successfully added

---

**Step 2**

1\. Connect the test user to 2 instances ex _Instance A_ and _Instance B_\
2. _Set _Instance A _as the default instance by clicking the ... menu on a post and creating an issue in this Jira instance\
3\. Use the "_/jira issue view"_ command to view an issue in _Instance A_ Such as "_/jira issue view EXT-122"_4. Switch the default instance by clicking the ... menu on a post and creating an issue in this Jira _Instance B_\
_5. Use the "_/jira issue view"_ command to view an issue in _Instance B_ Such as "\_/jira issue view DKH-100"\_\_

**Expected**

On 3. the user can use slash commands on _Instance A_ without passing in _-- instance_ as it is the default.\
\
On 5. the user can use slash commands on _Instance B_ without passing in _-- instance_ as it is now the default.

---

**Step 3**

1\. Ensure _Instance B _is still the default as it was set above\
2\. Assign as issue to someone in the default instance without passing in -- instance ex; _"_/jira issue assign DKH-100 dylan__\_\_"\_\_

**Expected**

DKH-100 is assigned to Dylan without having to specify what instance this takes place on.

---

**Step 4**

1\. Ensure _Instance B _is still the default as it was set above\
2\. Transition an issue to a new state in the default instance without passing in -- instance ex; _"_/jira issue transition DKH-100 done__\_\_"\_\_

**Expected**

DKH-100 is set to Done without having to specify what instance this takes place on.
