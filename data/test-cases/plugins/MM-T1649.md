## MM-T1649: Greater than 15 plugin buttons collapse to one icon in top nav

**Objective**

<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21247>\
<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22917>

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable plugins that add channel headers component, such as Zoom, To-Do, Demo plugin (<https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-demo/releases>), Webex, Skype. May use test plugin that generates 15 channel header icons - 'https\://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-test/releases/download/v0.1.0/com.mattermost.test-plugin-0.1.0.tar.gz'\
\
2\. Enable a sixth plugin that will add a channel header component, such as Jitsi (<https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jitsi/releases>)\
\
3\. With 16 plugins enabled and collapsed into one top nav icon (see step 2), disable one of the plugins.

**Expected**

On step 1, fifteen (15) individual plugin icons display in channel header / top nav.\
On step 2, more than five enabled plugins in channel header / top nav will collapse into one combined plugin icon, with drop-down of the plugins displaying on click. Number of plugins displays on icon.\
On step 3, verify the plugin icons in top nav expand out to show individually rather than being collapsed behind one icon.
