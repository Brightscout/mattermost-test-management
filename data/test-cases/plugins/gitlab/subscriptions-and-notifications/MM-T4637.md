## MM-T4637: Pipeline event notifications

---

**Step 1**

1\. From the GitLab UI, select _Pipelines _under _CI/CD_\
2\. Add a pipeline that will be triggered on each commit (the pipeline does not need top succeed or be functional)\
3\. In GitLab add a subscription to a channel that includes the \`pipeline\` event\
4\. In the GitLab project make a commit that will trigger the pipeline\
5\. Wait for the pipeline to fail or succeed\
