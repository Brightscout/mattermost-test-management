## MM-T4590: Subscription events are aware of labels

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create a subscription in a project without label ex: _/gitlab subscriptions add dhaussermann/dkh-public issues,merges"_\
2\. Create an issue in the target project with no label

_Important notes about this step:_

Ensure the project has a valid webhook to deliver the subscription event

**Expected**

Issue creation event is delivered

---

**Step 2**

1\. Update the subscription in a project with a label ex: _/gitlab subscriptions add dhaussermann/dkh-public issues,merges,label:"pineapple"_\
2\. Create an issue in the target project with no label

_Important notes about this step:_

Ensure the project has a valid webhook to deliver the subscription event

**Expected**

Issue creation event is \*\*notÂ \*\*delivered as the target label was missing

---

**Step 3**

1\. Create an issue in the target project **with the target label**

_Important notes about this step:_

Ensure the project has a valid webhook to deliver the subscription event

**Expected**

Issue creation event is delivered.
