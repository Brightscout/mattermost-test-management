## MM-T3612: Sent Items can be marked as Done

---

**Step 1**

1\. Send a ToDo to a user\
2\. Login as the receipient in a new session\
3\. Mark the ToDo as Done

**Expected**

\- The item is removed form recipient's list\
\- Sender receives a DM that the ToDo has been Done\
\- The item is no longer listed on the "sent" tab for the sender
