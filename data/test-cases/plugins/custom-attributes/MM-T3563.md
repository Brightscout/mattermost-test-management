---

**Step 1**

1\. Add a group ID to a cutom attribute record\
2\. Confirm a member of the target LDAP group that is not listed in the IDs section (as you will be adding the group they are part of instaed of listing the user individually)\
3\. Locate one or more members of the target group

**Expected**

All members of the group show the info on pop-over
