### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Zoom icon and surrounding elements display as expected in mobile/tablet view<br>————————————————————————————<br>On server with Zoom enabled (or fill in fake Zoom settings on test server and enable the plugin):<ol><li>Narrow your window until your view is switched to mobile view</li><li> Verify icons in top nav look normal (when it was broken, Zoom icon was replaced with a dot and hidden text and other icons shifted position unexpectedly)</li><li>Click the dropdown next to channel name to open channel menu</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>Channel menu formatting looks normal, and the Zoom item is text that says "Start Zoom Meeting" (as opposed to the Zoom icon displaying and messing up the list formatting)</li></ul></article>
