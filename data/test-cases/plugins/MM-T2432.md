## MM-T2432: Plugins Management - No 'Remove' option for pre-packaged plugins

---

**Step 1**

Plugins Management - No "Remove" option for pre-packaged plugins\
————————————————————————————

1. System Console ➜ Plugins ➜ Management
2. Scroll down and locate "Jira (pre-packaged)" and "Zoom (pre-packaged)" plugins

**Expected**

- You should not see an option to "Remove" these plugins as they are pre-packaged and will be reinstalled on server restart
