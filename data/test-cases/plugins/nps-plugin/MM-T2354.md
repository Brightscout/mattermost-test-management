## MM-T2354: End user completes and sends survey

---

**Step 1**

End user completes and sends survey\
————————————————————————————

1. Trigger survey; user sees DM from Surveybot that says:
   \
   \
   Hey @user! Please take a few moments to help us improve your experience with Mattermost.\
   How likely are you to recommend Mattermost?\
   \[drop-down with choices 1 to 10]
2. User selects a number from the drop-down

**Expected**

Drop-down in the survey post is replaced by:

- You selected 8 out of 10.

And a follow-up post appears:

- Thanks! How can we make your experience better?
  \
  (If user replies or posts following that message ⬆, it behaves as described in below test)
