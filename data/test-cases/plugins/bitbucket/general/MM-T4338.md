## MM-T4338: bitbucket links show popover in main thread

---

**Step 1**

1\. Open a channel and post a bitbucket link (ideally a public repo) such as: https\://bitbucket.com/DHaussermann/hello-world/issues/141\
2\. Mouse over the ink in the main thread

**Expected**

\- popover is shown in main thread\
\- popover resolution is reasonable\
\- Text wraps to fit into popover\
\- Additional text is truncated\
\- User theme is applied
