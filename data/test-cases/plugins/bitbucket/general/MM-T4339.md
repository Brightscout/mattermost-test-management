**Step 1**

1\. Open a channel and post a bitbucket link (ideally a public repo) such as: https\://bitbucket.org/DHaussermann/helloworld/issues/7/apples-went-sour\
2\. Open the reply thread for the post

**Expected**

\- popover is shown in reply thread\
\- popover resolution is reasonable\
\- Text wraps to fit into popover\
\- Additional text is truncated\
\- User theme is applied
