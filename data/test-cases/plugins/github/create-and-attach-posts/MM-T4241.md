## MM-T4241: Create issues modal shows no options to add labels and milestones.

---

**Step 1**

1\. Connect to GitHub as a user in an Enterprise group with Read permissions\
2\. Open the GitHub create modal for a Mattermost post\
3\. Select the repo from the Enterprise Org where you have Read permissions

**Expected**

When repo is selected, Milestones and Labels options are not shown in modal as the connected user's permissions do not include adding labels or milestones
