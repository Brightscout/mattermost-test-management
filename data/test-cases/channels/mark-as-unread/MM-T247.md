**Test Data**

**Note to Step 4**: A use case for marking it as unread might be that the user doesn't have time to read the post right then but doesn't want to lose track of it.

**Expected**

On Step 1:

- Channel becomes unread on the LHS and shows correct mention bubble with the count
- Once **UserB** clicks on that channel the count vanishes
- New Messages line appears above the post

\
On Step 2:

- The New message line is gone

\
On Step 3:

- The New message line is gone

\
On Step 4:

- New Messages line remains above the marked post, Channel becomes unread on the LHS and shows correct mention bubble with the count

\
On Step 5:

- Message is **still** marked unread upon returning
- Channel count is missing

\
On Step 6:

- Message is **still** marked unread after refresh
- Channel count is missing
