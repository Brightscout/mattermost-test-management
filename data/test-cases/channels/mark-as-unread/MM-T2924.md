## MM-T2924: Channel is marked as read as soon as user leaves

---

**Step 1**

- Users A and B are in channel X.
- User B sends a message and as soon as they sent it, user A clicks on channel Y to switch to it.

**Expected**

- Channel X is marked as read right before User A leaves it, not after having switched to Y.
- Channel X should not show as unread on the LHS, not even briefly

---

**Step 2**

- Open channel X again and mark any post as unread manually (using ALT+click or ... menu option)
- Switch to a different channel

**Expected**

- Channel X should be marked as unread
