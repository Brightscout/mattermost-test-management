## MM-T1429: Verify unread toast appears as expected after repeated manual marking of posts as unread

---

**Step 1**

Verify unread toast appears as expected after repeated manual marking of posts as unread\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Open a channel with unread messages
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page, this should clear the toast
3. Scroll back up and mark a message as unread
4. Then scroll back down to clear the toast
5. Scroll back up and mark another message as unread (observe the toast shows back up. If you switch channel and come back to the channel the toast will be present)
