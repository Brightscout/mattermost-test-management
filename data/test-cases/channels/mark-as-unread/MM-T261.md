## MM-T261: RN apps: Mark as unread while app is closed

---

**Step 1**

RN: Mark as unread while app is closed\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log into MM from two separate devices, at least one of which is mobile
2. Close the app on the mobile app
3. Mark the channel as unread from the other device with at least 1 mention message being below the New Messages line
4. Reopen the app on the mobile device

**Expected**

- **iOS**:

  - The app badge should be updated to match the number of unread mentions on the left side of the channel header whenever a channel is marked as unread, even if it happens from another device and/or when the app is closed.

- **Android:**

  - The app badge will not be updated, but the user should not receive any erroneous notifications when marking a channel as unread from another device.
