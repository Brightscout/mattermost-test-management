(**Story**) [Prevent marking a channel as read when user manually marked as unread — MM-17754](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17754)

**Expected**

- On 3, new message line appears above the marked post.
- On 4, channel A becomes unread on the LHS.
- On 5, channel A becomes read and new message line should still be visible above the post when switching back to unread channel.
- On 6, channel A is marked as read.
