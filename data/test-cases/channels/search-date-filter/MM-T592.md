## MM-T592: after: can be used in conjunction with in: and from:

---

**Step 1**

1. Locate a target post and note the date, author and channel
2. Locate or create a more recent post with some of the same text in a different channel and a different author. Note the author and channel
3. Search for the text common to both posts with a filter "after:" less than the date of the first post

after: can be used in conjunction with in: and from:\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
1\. Add "in:" and specify the channel that the post from "step A" occurred in and search
