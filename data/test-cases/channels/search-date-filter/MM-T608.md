**Step 1**

Negative before: filter\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post a message with a unique word (ex. foobarbaz)
2. Search for the unique word and with a filter of "before:TOMORROWS\_DATE" (TOMORROWS\_DATE should be selected via the date picker).
3. Search for the unique word with a negative filter of "-before:TOMORROWS\_DATE" (TOMORROWS\_DATE should be selected via the date picker).

**Expected**

- On step 2, search results that include the post with your unique word.
- On step 3, search results should not include your new post.
