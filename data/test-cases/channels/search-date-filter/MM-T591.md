## MM-T591: before: can be used in conjunction with in: and from:

---

**Step 1**

1. Locate a target post and note the date, author and channel
2. Locate or create a more recent post with some of the same text in a different channel and a different author. Note the author and channel
3. Search for the text common to both posts with a filter "before:" greater than the date of the second post (this can be in the future if the post from step 2 occurred today)

before: can be used in conjunction with in:\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
1\. Add "in:" and specify the channel that the post from step A occurred in and search
