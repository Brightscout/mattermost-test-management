- [RN: Search date picker, on edit, replaces the date and leaves old date info, adds to search term — MM-24029](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-24029)

**Expected**

After step 2:\\

- Date format should be in ISO8601 format yyyy-mm-dd
- Search works as expected

After step 4:\\

- You should see a tooltip "Clear"
- Search query should be cleared and previous search results should remain in the RHS
