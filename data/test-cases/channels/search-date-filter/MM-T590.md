## MM-T590: on: will take preference over 'after:' and 'before:' if either exists in the same search

---

**Step 1**

on: will take preference over "after:" and "before:" if either exists in the same search\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Locate a target post and note the date
2. Locate or create a more recent post with some of the same text
3. Add search terms common to both post to the search box
4. Add "before:" to your search term(s) and specify the date earlier than the date that the post from step A occurred on
5.  Add "after:" to your search term(s) and specify the date earlier than the date that the post from step B occurred on
6. Add "On:" and specify a date other than the date the post from step A occurred on and search
