1. As User1, create new root post in Off topic mentioning User2 and reply to it

   1. Verify for User1 this channel is **not** bolded
   2. Verify channel item **doesn't** have mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge
   5. Verify main channel root post has a thread footer and **no** unread dot
   6. Verify **no** new messages line on the channel

2. Login as User2

   1. Verify Off Topic sidebar item is **not** bolded
   2. Verify channel item **doesn't** have mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is bolded
   4. Verify global threads item has a mention badge

3. Open Off Topic

   1. Verify main channel root post has a thread footer and an unread dot
   2. Verify **no** new messages line on the channel

4. Read the thread

   1. Verify root post shows Following
   2. Verify global threads is **not** bold and **no** longer shows mention badge

5. As User2 open the post in global treads inbox

6. While holding `ALT` click on the root post with mention

   2. Verify global threads item is bolded
   3. Verify global threads item **doesn't** show a mention badge
   4. Verify new message line below root post in thread inbox

Global threads bolded with **no** badge. Even though the root post has a mention, the threads view does not get mention badge because the new messages line goes below the root post.
