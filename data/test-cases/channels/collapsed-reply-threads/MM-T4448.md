**Step 1**

_Use “Mark all as unread” button_\
\\

1. Create new post as user1

2. Reply to post as user2

3. Open global threads as user1

   1. Verify unread blue dot on Unread tab, noting user has an unread thread  

4. Click on “Mark all as unread” button

   1. Verify thread is marked as read, Unread tab no longer shows blue dot, right pane shows “Looks like you’re all caught up”
