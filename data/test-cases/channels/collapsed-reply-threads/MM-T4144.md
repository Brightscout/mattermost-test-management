## MM-T4144: CRT - Show new message line for the unread thread

---

**Step 1**

_CRT - Show new message line for the unread thread_

1. Go to channel with 2 members (user1, user2)

2. Post a message as user1 

3. Post a reply as the other user, user2

4. As user1, click on the root post to open the thread in the RHS

   1. Verify new line is visible on the RHS above the post from user2

5. Close RHS

**Expected**

- New message line is shown on the unread thread

---

**Step 2**

_CRT - Do not show new message line after viewing the thread_

1. Get the last message  in the channel (from the previous step)

2. Click on the message to open on the RHS

   1. Verify RHS opens and new message line is **not** visible 

3. Close RHS

**Expected**

- New message line is no longer shown on the previously viewed thread
