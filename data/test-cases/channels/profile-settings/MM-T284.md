**Step 1**

Profile picture updates immediately while viewed by other user and also by self in another tab\

2. Also open another tab on that browser with that same user logged in
3. Have another user in another browser view the first user's profile pic
4. Change first user's Profile Pic

- Profile pic in Message Details pane updates, like profile pics in Center Channel
- Other user sees profile pic update immediately
- Same user on different tab in same browser sees profile pic update immediately
