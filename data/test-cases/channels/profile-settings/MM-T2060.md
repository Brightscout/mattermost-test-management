## MM-T2060: Nickname and username styles

---

**Step 1**

Nickname and username styles\
———————————————————————

1. Go to User menu > Profile > Profile Settings > Nickname > Edit
2. Set nickname and full name
3. With nickname and full name set: View Add or Manage Members list

Note: This should apply to the following dialogs for webapp

- Add Members to Channel
- Manage Members lists
- More Direct Messages list

**Expected**

- "@" should be in front of the username field, so it's more obvious what is the username (second screenshot)
- Username should be in black text, but other name fields lighter colour, consistent with user autocomplete (second & third screenshots).
