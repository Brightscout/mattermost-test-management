### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>CTRL/CMD+K<br /><br />Setup for following tests<br /><br />Display order of search results<br />--------------------<br />On a team with enough channels to observe alphabetical order (with some channels that have the first letter in common):<br /><br />1. Ensure there are also GMs and DMs that can start with the same letter, or create GM channels and/or users if needed<br />2. Press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (Mac)<br />3. Type the first letter in the &quot;Switch Channels&quot; modal message box</article>

**Expected**

> <article>- Channels are ordered by channels, DMs and GMs you belong to listed first<br /><br />- Results that *begin* with the letter you searched on appear (in alpha order) above results that just *contain* the letter (then in alpha order again) <br /><br />- Each channel type has an appropriate icon next to the channel name: [globe for public; lock for private; profile picture for DMs and GMs]<br /><br />- Display of DM / GMs matches message autocomplete, i.e. &quot;@username - FirstName LastName (Nickname)&quot;<br /><br />- Deactivated users appear at the bottom of the user list</article>
