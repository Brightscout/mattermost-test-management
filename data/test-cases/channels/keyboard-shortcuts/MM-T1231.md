**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>Each time a user presses ALT+SHIFT+UP, they navigate to a channel immediately above the current channel in the left hand sidebar with unread messages.</li><li>If the current channel is at the very top of the left hand sidebar, ALT+SHIFT+UP brings the user to the bottom of the channel list in the left hand sidebar with unread messages</li><li>Once there are no unread channels, ALT+SHIFT+UP does nothing.</li><li>This should hold for favourite channels as well</li></ul></article>
