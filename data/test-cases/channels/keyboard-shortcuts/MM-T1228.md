## MM-T1228: CTRL/CMD+K - Open DM with user not on the current team

---

**Step 1**

CTRL/CMD+K - Open DM with user not on the current team\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Identify a user who doesn't belong to the same team
2. Press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (Mac)
3. Type the username from step 1 and select the username

**Expected**

Direct message channel with the user opens\
\
Note: If the setting in System Console is set to disallow DMs with users on other teams, then this will fail. Test servers should be safe to not have that setting set (nor community-release).
