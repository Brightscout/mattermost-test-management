## MM-T1229: ALT+UP

---

**Step 1**

ALT+UP\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Ensure there is at least one public channel, one private channel and one direct message channel created and visible on the left hand sidebar
2. Ensure there is at least one public channel, one private channel and one direct message channel created and listed under FAVORITE CHANNELS
3. Go to Town Square (or its equivalent).
4. Press ALT+UP and monitor behaviour in the left hand sidebar

**Expected**

- Each time a user presses ALT+UP, they navigate to a channel immediately above the current channel in the left hand sidebar.
- If the current channel is at the very top of the left hand sidebar, ALT+UP brings the user to the bottom of the channel list in the left hand sidebar
- This should hold for favourite channels as well
