**Step 1**

1. Search for something
2. Press CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+L

_Important notes about this step:_

One exception: If the right-hand sidebar is open **and fully expanded in a message reply**, then CTRL+SHIFT+L should set focus to the reply thread.

**Expected**

- Focus is set to center channel message box
