## MM-T1247: CTRL/CMD+K - Only highlights one match if multiple channels with same name

---

**Step 1**

1. Create a channel with the same name as a username
2. Use CMD/CTRL+K to open the quick switcher
3. Start searching for the channel with the same name as a username

_Related ticket(s):_

(Won't Fix) [Channel with same name as a username causes double cursor in quick switcher â€” MM-11193](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-11193)

**Expected**

- Single preselection appears on the first channel matching the search term (rather than both channels being highlighted as selected)
