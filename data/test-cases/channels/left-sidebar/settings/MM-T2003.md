## MM-T2003: Settings > Sidebar > Number of direct messages to show

---

**Step 1**

Settings ➜ Sidebar ➜ Number of direct messages to show\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
_Setting Number of direct messages to show_\
Note: Experimental Sidebar Feature is set to default ON for both on-prem and cloud instances

1. Collapse the DM category (so that we can check all unread DMs quickly without the sidebar scrolling behind an issue)

2. Open 41 DMs/GMs on the sidebar (ie. one over the max displayable read limit)

3. Create a new user to have a DM with

4. Post a message as the new user

   1. Verify that the DM count is now correct 

5. Click on the new DM channel to mark it read

6. Expand the DM category 

   1. Verify that there are 20 DMs shown in the sidebar

7. Navigate to Settings ➜ Sidebar

   1. Observe that the current limit on DMs/GMs is shown (should be 20 by default)

8. Click Edit on that setting and change it to `All Direct Messages`

9. Click Save and close Settings modal

   1. Verify that there are 41 DMs shown in the sidebar 

10. Navigate to Settings ➜ Sidebar

11. Click Edit and change it to `10`

12. Click Save and close Settings modal

    1. Verify that there are 10 DMs shown in the sidebar

**Expected**

- Verify default setting for number of direct messages is 20
- Verify user is able to change & save the setting and that the change can be observed/verified on the sidebar
