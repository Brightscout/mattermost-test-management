_Setting Number of direct messages to show_\
Note: Experimental Sidebar Feature is set to default ON for both on-prem and cloud instances

2. Open 41 DMs/GMs on the sidebar (ie. one over the max displayable read limit)

3. Create a new user to have a DM with

4. Post a message as the new user

   1. Verify that the DM count is now correct 

5. Click on the new DM channel to mark it read

6. Expand the DM category 

   1. Verify that there are 20 DMs shown in the sidebar

7. Navigate to Settings ➜ Sidebar
