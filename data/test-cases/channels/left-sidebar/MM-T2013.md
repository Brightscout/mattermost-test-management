## MM-T2013: Sidebar with banner present

---

**Step 1**

1. Have a banner appear in the app by either

   1. Turning it on from the system console
   2. Being on a community server when it updates to a new version
   3. Being on a server without email notifications and with the preview mode banner enabled

2. Ensure you have enough channels in the sidebar for a scroll bar to appear and also More Unreads toast

3. Scroll through channels

   1. Verify you can scroll to view every channel in the sidebar and the More Unreads indicator is always on screen.
