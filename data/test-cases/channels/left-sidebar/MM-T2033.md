## MM-T2033: Skip API calls to get user info for GM's that are hidden on LHS

**Precondition**

- Test on community-release
- Ensure your test user or staff Mattermost user has Account Settings > Sidebar> Automatically Close Direct Messages> After 7 days with no new messages  <- enabled and has old GMs that have been auto-closed due to this setting

---

**Step 1**

- Ensure your test user or staff Mattermost user has Settings ➜ Sidebar ➜ Automatically Close Direct Messages enabled

   AFTER 7 DAYS WITH NO NEW MESSAGES

- Your test user should have some GMs older then 7 days, that have been auto-closed for lack of interaction and are not shown on the LHS

**Test Data**

**Step 2**

- Open Dev Tools > Network 
- Filter by 'users?'

---

**Step 3**

- Count your open GMs on the LHS and verify that only as many calls are made on the network tab in dev tools as there are open GMs
- Refresh the browser if needed

**Expected**

Only as many call are made as there are GMs on the LHS

- e.g. if you have only 3 open GMs, only 3 calls should be made and your older than 7 days GMs that were auto-closed should not be causing any call to be made here

---

**Step 4**

- Manually close one GM by clicking on the \`x\` to remove it from the LHS and refresh the browser 

**Expected**

- You should see one less call made than in the previous step
