## MM-T3297: Moving channels when some are archived

---

**Step 1**

1. Create a custom category
2. Move some categories into it
3. Archive one of the channels
4. Attempt to move some channels into or out of that category

**Expected**

Verify that you're able to move channels in and out of that category

---

**Step 2**

1. Move/rearrange channels within the same category that has archived channels

**Expected**

Verify channels are dropping in the right position when archived channels are also present within the category
