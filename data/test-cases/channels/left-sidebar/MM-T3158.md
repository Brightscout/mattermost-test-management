**Step 1**

Drag and Drop DMs\
————————————————————————————

1. Hover over DMs on the sidebar

**Expected**

- Small drag handle displays on the left of the channel type icon
- Mouse cursor changes to Hand Pointer Finger

---

**Step 2**

1. Pick up any DM to move

**Expected**

- Mouse cursor becomes dragging cursor - closed hand
- DM being dragged should float beneath the mouse cursor
- Channels category dims

---

**Step 3**

1. Drag DM over DM Category

**Expected**

- The whole DM category is outlined to indicate that the entire DM category is a dropzone

---

**Step 4**

1. Drag a DM over Channels category header while category is expanded

**Expected**

- Channels category remains dimmed and does not expand or give indication DM can be dropped there

---

**Step 6**

1. Drag a DM over any custom Category header (or Favorited) while that category is collapsed

_Important notes about this step:_

When a channel (that is not currently open in the main view) is moved to a category that is collapsed the category shows an indication that channel will drop in the first position even though it will not be visible/shown there immediately - Expected?

**Expected**

- Category header is outlined indicating items can be dropped there
- Shows an indication that channel will drop in the first position

---

**Step 7**

1. Drag a DM over any custom Category header (or Favorites) while that category is expanded

**Expected**

- Category header is outlined indicating items can be dropped there
- Shows an indication that channel will drop in the first position
- DMs can be dropped between exising channels

---

**Step 8**

1. Drag a DM in any direction

**Expected**

- Item can be dragged in any direction, vertically or horizontally
- Can't drop cursor is shown when hovering outside of sidebar or non-droppable areas on the sidebar

---

**Step 9**

1. Drag a DM to near top or bottom of the sidebar to trigger scrolling

**Expected**

- Scrolling while dragging is allowed
- Scrolling should be smooth, not sticky or jumpy

---

**Step 10**

1. Drag a DM and press ESC

**Expected**

- Dragging is canceled
- DM is returned to its original position

---

**Step 11**
