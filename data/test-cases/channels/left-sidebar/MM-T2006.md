## MM-T2006: Collapsed categories in other sessions

---

**Step 1**

1. Log in as a normal user into few different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and/or Edge) using the same test server
2. Collapse categories in one browser and verify collapsed state is applied to other sessions in real time
3. Logout and log back in and verify that existing collapse/expand category state is maintained (should not uncollapse categories)

**Expected**

- Collapsed/expanded state is applied to other sessions in real time
- Category state is not cleared by logging out, persists.
