**Step 1**

   1. Verify that unread filter is in all channels state

2. Create two channels AAA and BBB

3. Stay on channel BBB

4. As a different user mention first user on channel AAA and archive it

   1. Verify that the first channel, channel AAA has a mention
   2. Verify that channel AAA is archived

5. As first user while still viewing channel BBB - Enable Unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is in filter by unread state
   2. Verify that the archived channel AAA with a mention is not visible on the LHS
