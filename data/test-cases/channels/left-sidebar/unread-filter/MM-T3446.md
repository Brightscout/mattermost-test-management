## MM-T3446: Channel Sidebar Unread Filter > Show Muted with mentions in All Unreads

---

**Step 1**

1. Login as normal user

   1. Verify that unread filter is in all channels state

2. Create a couple of new channels,\
   1st should be unread with mentions\
   2nd unread without mentions

   1. Verify that the channels are correctly unread

3. Open the channel menu and mute both of them

   1. Verify that the first channel has a mention and is muted
   2. Verify that the second channel does not have a mention and is muted

4. Enable Unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is in filter by unread state
   2. Verify that the muted channel with a mention is still visible
   3. Verify that the muted channel without a mention has been hidden

5. Disable the unread filter

   1. Verify that the muted channel without a mention has reappeared

**Expected**

- LHS should also show muted unread channels with mentions when Â filter is enabled, muted channel should be sorted on the bottom of unread list
