---

**Step 1**

1. Login as normal user

   1. Verify that unread filter is in all channels state, not enabled

2. Create a couple of new channels, both of which are unread

3. Enable Unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is in filter by unread state
   2. Verify that both channels are visible

4. Click on the first channel

   1. Verify that both channels are still visible

5. Click on the second channel

   1. Verify that the first channel has disappeared

6. Disable the unread filter

**Expected**

- We should hide channels once they have been read
