## MM-T3443: Channel Sidebar Unread Filter > Show only All Unreads when enabled

---

**Step 1**

1. Login as normal user

   1. Verify that unread filter is in all channels state

2. Create a couple of new channels, one of which is unread and one of which is not

   1. Verify that the channels are correctly read and unread

3. Enable Unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is in filter by unread state
   2. Verify that the read channel has been hidden
   3. Verify that the unread channel is still visible

4. Disable the unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is back in all channels state, and the read channel has reappeared

**Expected**

- Should only show unread channels with filter enabled
