## MM-T3803: Custom categories should not become empty when user is removed/leaves the team

---

**Step 1**

Custom categories should not become empty when user is removed/leaves the team\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Be a member of at least 2 teams
2. Create a few custom categories on each team with a DM/GM in at least one of them
3. Leave the team with a DM in a custom category or have another user remove you from that team
4. Refresh the page

**Expected**

- The custom categories remain populated on the second team, (note: channels/dms should not be moved back to Channels or DM categories)
