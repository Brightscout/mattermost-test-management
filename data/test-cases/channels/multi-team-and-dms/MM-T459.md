### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Group Messaging: Add first user<br>--------------------<br>1. Scroll to the foot of the DIRECT MESSAGES list and click `More` (RN apps: Tap `+` next to Direct Messages)<br>2. Start typing a username in the search bar, observe user list filtered, still in alpha order<br>3. Select an autocomplete option by using arrow buttons and pressing Enter (mobile just tap a selection; no arrow buttons on mobile)</article>

**Test Data**

**Expected**

> <article>- After step 3: Selected username appears in the search box to the left of the cursor with an &quot;x&quot; for deletion<br />- Selected user no longer appears in user list (except for RN apps; still appears)<br />- Focus is still in search box<br />- Search term disappears<br />- User list is no longer filtered (but still alpha order)<br />- (N/A for RN apps:) Message says &quot;You can add 6 more people.&quot;</article>
