\--------------------\
1\. Scroll to the foot of the DIRECT MESSAGES list and click \`More\` (RN apps: Tap \`+\` next to Direct Messages)\
2\. Start typing a username in the search bar, observe user list filtered, still in alpha order\
3\. Select an autocomplete option by using arrow buttons and pressing Enter (mobile just tap a selection; no arrow buttons on mobile)

\- Selected user no longer appears in user list (except for RN apps; still appears)\
\- Focus is still in search box\
\- Search term disappears\
\- User list is no longer filtered (but still alpha order)\
\- (N/A for RN apps:) Message says "You can add 6 more people."
