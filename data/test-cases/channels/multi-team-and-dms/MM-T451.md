**Step 1**

> <article>Send a DM to someone on no team<br />--------------------<br />1. Log in as User A, and leave all teams <br />- NOTE: You will NOT be able to re-join private channels without being invited to them, so use a test account you don't mind having lose all their channels<br />- Main Menu &gt; Leave Team for each team you are on<br /><br />2. Log in as User B and send User A a direct message<br />3. Have User A re-join one of the teams</article>

**Test Data**

| Important notes about this step | Note: Removed a vague "expected" at the good suggestion of the contributor working on this test case. :)&nbsp; For posterity it was:<br><br>If User A is still logged in and viewing the Team Selection page, (depending on notifications settings), they may get a desktop notification, and clicking it may join their most recent team or may show error page "Team Not Found" depending on team settings |
