---

**Step 1**

Create GM with same members as a previous GM that has been removed from LHS\
\--------------------\
1\. Post a message in a GM\
2\. Make a note of all of the users in the GM (ensure that none of the users has been deactivated)\
3\. Click the "x" next to the GM channel name to remove it from sidebar (RN apps tap channel name and Close channel)\
4\. Click "More..." at the bottom of the DM channel list\
5\. Select the exact same users who were in the GM you deleted, and click "Go" / "Start"

**Test Data**

FIXED v5.10 <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14386>

**Expected**

GM appears in LHS DM list again.\
Previous messages in that GM's history display in center channel.\

NOTE: It is expected that you cannot re-open a GM that includes a deactivated user this way
