## MM-T476: Remove GM from LHS and re-add through Jump link

---

**Step 1**

1\. View a GM you want to close\
2\. Flag a message in the channel\
3\. In the LHS, click the "x" that appears to the right of the channel name on hover (no hover on mobile; it just always shows) and verify that GM channel disappears from LHS\
4\. Refresh and verify GM is still not listed in LHS\
5\. Click flag icon to view flagged posts\
6\. Cilck `Jump` next to the message from the GM you closed

**Expected**

Clicking `Jump` opens the GM in center channel and re-adds the GM to LHS channel list\
\
Count of Members shown for GM should be correct
