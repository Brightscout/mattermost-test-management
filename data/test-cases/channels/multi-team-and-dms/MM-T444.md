## MM-T444: DM More... show user count

---

**Step 1**

DM More... show user count\
\--------------------\
1\. Click More... below Direct Messages in LHS\
2\. Observe user count in the modal, which shows the number of users on that page and the total number of users (such as "12 of 12 members" or "50 of 200 members")\
3\. Type a couple letters in the Search field that will match at least two users

**Test Data**

Can test on community-release if needed to have more users to search.

**Expected**

User count in modal changes on being filtered, to show the number now being displayed. Total number of users stays the same.\
\
Confirm that help text "Use up/down arrows..." and "xx of xxxxx members" is on one line below text input box
