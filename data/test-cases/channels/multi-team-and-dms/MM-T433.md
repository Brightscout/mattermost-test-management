<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Switch Teams<br />--------------------<br />1. Log in to Team A with an account that has joined multiple teams<br />2. Open several DM channels, including accounts that are not on Team B<br />3. Click Team B in the team sidebar<br />4. Post a message in Town Square in Team B<br />5. Click Team A in the team sidebar</article>

**Expected**

> <article>=- Channel list in the LHS is scrolled to the top<br />- Verify team display name changes correctly, posting a message works properly, and there is no cross contamination between teams.<br />- Channel viewed on team a before switching should be the one that displays after switching back (Town Square does not briefly show)<br />- DM Channel list should be the same on both teams with no missing names.</article>
