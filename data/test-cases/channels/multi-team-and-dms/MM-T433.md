## MM-T433: Switch Teams

---

**Step 1**

Switch Teams\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in to Team A with an account that has joined multiple teams\
2\. Open several DM channels, including accounts that are not on Team B\
3\. Click Team B in the team sidebar\
4\. Post a message in Town Square in Team B\
5\. Click Team A in the team sidebar

**Expected**

\=- Channel list in the LHS is scrolled to the top\
\- Verify team display name changes correctly, posting a message works properly, and there is no cross contamination between teams.\
\- Channel viewed on team a before switching should be the one that displays after switching back (Town Square does not briefly show)\
\- DM Channel list should be the same on both teams with no missing names.
