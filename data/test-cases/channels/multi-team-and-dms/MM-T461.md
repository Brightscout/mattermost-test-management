### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>RN - All search results are available when the keyboard is showing<br>--------------------<br><strong><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">**Test on a server with many users (probably not rc.test), such as postgres.test or mysql.test**<br></span></strong><br>1. Open "New Conversation" by tapping "+" next to "DIRECT MESSAGES"<br>2. Enter a couple of characters to search for a user, ensuring more than a screenful worth of results<br>3. Attempt to scroll the list with the search term still present</article>

**Test Data**

> <article>**Test on a server with many users (probably not rc.test), such as postgres.test or mysql.test*</article>

**Expected**

> <article>The current excpected behavior is to hide the keyboard with any user interaction. For this test, the keyboard should hide as soon as the user beigns scrolling.<br /><br /><br />Previous expected behavior for the test was incorrect: Can scroll list to the bottom and interact with all results (the bottom of the list doesn't get 'stuck' under an open keyboard)</article>
