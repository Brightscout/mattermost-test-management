---

**Step 1**

1. DM channel name drop-down
2. Select "Mute channel"
3. Click on the bell with a line through it to the right of the DM name

**Expected**

On 2, you should see a bell with a line through it to the right of the DM channel name and the DM channel should move to the bottom of your DM list and be slightly dimmer than the rest of your DM channels.\
\
On 3, the bell should disappear and the DM should move back to the position it was in in the LHS and no longer be dimmer than the rest of your DM channels.
