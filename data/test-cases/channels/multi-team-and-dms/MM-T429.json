Have user1 in webapp / desktop app set their status to away (can use drop-down or /away)<br />2. Have user1 in webapp / desktop app post a message in any channel<br />2. Log in to that same server on RN app as a different user and open a DM with user1<br />3. Switch channels to locate the post from user1 from step 2<br />3. Observe that status of user1 is away (may take a minute or so to update)<br />4. Have user1 set their status in web browser to DND - Do Not Disturb (can use status drop-down in top left)<br />5. In the RN app, keep the app open without interacting with it, and wait a few minutes, watching for user1's status to update to DND",
