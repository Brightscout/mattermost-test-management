## MM-T421: Multiteam Channel Creation

**Precondition**

Not being tested manually, but is marked To-Do for Cypress, so leaving this test in place for now.

---

**Step 1**

Multiteam Channel Creation\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**On an account that is on at least two teams**:

1. Log in to Team A
2. Open another window of Mattermost in either the same browser or a different one
3. Go to Team B with the other window
4. Create a channel

**Expected**

- New channel should only show up in the LHS of the team the channel was created in
- Ensure member count properly shows "1" immediately after channel was created.
