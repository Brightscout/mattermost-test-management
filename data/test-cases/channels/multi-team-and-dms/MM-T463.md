### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>GM: Maximum users<br>--------------------<br>1. Add 7 users to the same GM (but don't Save yet)<br>2. Non-RN: Verify says "You can add 0 more people" and also "You've reached the maximum number of people for this conversation. Consider creating a private channel instead."<br>3. Try to click another user from the list or use arrows to highlight a user and press Enter<br>4. Verify additional user is not added to the list at the top<br>5. Save / Start to open GM channel<br>6. Click channel name &gt; Add Members (still says you can add zero members)<br>7. Backspace or click "x" next to a username to remove it from the GM</article>

**Expected**

> <article>After last step, message says "You can add 1 more person."<br>Also says "This will start a new conversation. If you're adding a lot of people, consider creating a private channel instead."<br><br>Desktop Only:<br>Ensure that "Write to..." text in main input box is truncated and does not wrap if all of the names are too long<br><br>(Can then add another user and Save to open the GM)</article>
