### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Staus changes made in other clients are reflected in RN<br />--------------------<br />1. Have user1 in webapp / desktop app set their status to away (can use drop-down or /away)<br />2. Have user1 in webapp / desktop app post a message in any channel<br />2. Log in to that same server on RN app as a different user and open a DM with user1<br />3. Switch channels to locate the post from user1 from step 2<br />3. Observe that status of user1 is away (may take a minute or so to update)<br />4. Have user1 set their status in web browser to DND - Do Not Disturb (can use status drop-down in top left)<br />5. In the RN app, keep the app open without interacting with it, and wait a few minutes, watching for user1's status to update to DND</article>

**Test Data**

> <article>FIXED v1.22<br>- <a href="https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17588" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17588</a><br>- <a href="https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17612" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17612</a></article>

**Expected**

> <article>The RN app user's view should update to reflect status changes made by the webapp user (can take a minute or couple minutes but should update on its own eventually)</article>
