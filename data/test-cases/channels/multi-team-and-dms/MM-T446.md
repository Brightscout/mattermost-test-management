## MM-T446: DM More... searching from page 2 of user list

---

**Step 1**

DM More... searching from page 2 of user list\
\--------------------\
Test this one on a server such as postgres.test or mysql.test that has lots of users:\
\
On a server with enough users that they don't all fit in a single page in the Direct Messages modal (or so they trigger infinite scroll in RN apps):\
1\. Click More... under DM list (RN apps: scroll to load another page of users)\
2\. Click Next to show the 2nd page (RN apps: continue scrolling down several times to load more records)\
3\. Click in the text box and start typing someone's name

_Important notes about this step:_

**NOTE: WHEN SETTING UP IN RAINFOREST, USE THE /test users COMMAND TO ADD EXTRA USERS TO THE SERVER**

**Expected**

When the search term changes, you're automatically sent to the first page of results for that term
