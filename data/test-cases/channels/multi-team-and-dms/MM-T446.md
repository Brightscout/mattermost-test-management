### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>DM More... searching from page 2 of user list<br />--------------------<br />Test this one on a server such as postgres.test or mysql.test that has lots of users:<br /><br />On a server with enough users that they don't all fit in a single page in the Direct Messages modal (or so they trigger infinite scroll in RN apps):<br />1. Click More... under DM list (RN apps: scroll to load another page of users)<br />2. Click Next to show the 2nd page (RN apps: continue scrolling down several times to load more records)  <br />3. Click in the text box and start typing someone's name</article>

**Expected**

> <article>When the search term changes, you're automatically sent to the first page of results for that term</article>
