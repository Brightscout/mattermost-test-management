## MM-T445: DM more... user selection doesn't move to the first option

**Precondition**

**Not currently being tested manually, but marked To-Do for Cypress, so leaving in place for now.**

---

**Step 1**

DM more... user selection doesn't move to the first option\
\--------------------\
1\. Click the + sign to start a DM (or "More...")\
2\. In the "Direct Message" modal filter the list so that there are a few names\
3\. Move down a few names by clicking the down arrow\
4\. Wait 5-10 seconds

**Expected**

The highlight stays on the selected user and doesn't move the the first listed user
