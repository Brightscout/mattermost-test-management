## MM-T468: GM: Add member to existing GM

---

**Step 1**

GM: Add member to existing GM\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. View existing GM that has 3 to 6 total people in it, and also has messages in it

2.  To the right of channel name, click down arrow and select "Add Members"\
   \
   After step 2:

   - User list modal opens, message says "This will start a new conversation. If you're adding a lot of people, consider creating a private channel instead."
   - Users already in the GM are listed in the search box

3. Type a search term and select an autocomplete option

4. Click Go

(Won't do) [RC Testing: missing "Add Members" item in context menu — MM-29373](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-29373)

**Expected**

After step 4:

- Modal closes, center channel displays new GM with the original members, plus the one just added, and messaging "This is the start of your group message history...".
- Messages in previous GM before new member was added are not displayed.

**Note**: If you follow those steps with a GM that already has the maximum number of users in it, the messaging will say `You've reached the maximum number of people for this conversation. Consider creating a private channel instead.`
