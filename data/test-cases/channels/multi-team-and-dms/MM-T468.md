### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>GM: Add member to existing GM<br />–––––––––––––––––––––––––<ol><li>View existing GM that has 3 to 6 total people in it, and also has messages in it</li><li> To the right of channel name, click down arrow and select "Add Members"<br /><br />After step 2:<ul><li>User list modal opens, message says "This will start a new conversation. If you're adding a lot of people, consider creating a private channel instead."</li><li>Users already in the GM are listed in the search box<br /><br /></li></ul></li><li>Type a search term and select an autocomplete option</li><li>Click Go</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>After step 4:<ul><li>Modal closes, center channel displays new GM with the original members, plus the one just added, and messaging "This is the start of your group message history...".</li><li>Messages in previous GM before new member was added are not displayed.<br /><br /></li></ul><strong>Note</strong>: If you follow those steps with a GM that already has the maximum number of users in it, the messaging will say `You've reached the maximum number of people for this conversation. Consider creating a private channel instead.`</article>
