## MM-T448: Mention one user in a different user's DM channel

---

**Step 1**

Mention one user in a different user's DM channel\
\--------------------\
1\. Send a DM to one user that includes an at-mention of another user (who you can log in as)\
2\. View the at-mentioned user's account in separate device or browser

**Expected**

\- On posting the message, the sender does \*not\* see a warning that the at-mentioned user isn't in the channel and won't receive a notification (that shouldn't happen in DMs or GMs)\
\- The at-mentioned user gets NO notification or message for the mention
