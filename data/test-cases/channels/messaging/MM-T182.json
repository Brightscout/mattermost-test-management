Switch your keyboard to a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean keyboard (settings vary by OS)<br />- In general: Should be able to add in System / Keyboard settings, then view Mattermost, then click or tap keyboard settings icon to toggle it<br /><br />2. Type characters in message box and post; you will likely see some characters combining as you type, and that is the expected behavior<br />3. Open reply to that message, type a reply, post the reply<br /><br />If you want to repro a specific Korean example:<br />- Set keyboard to use 2-Set Korean<br />- Type the following sequence of letters (do not copy/paste): <br /><br />dkssuggktpdy<br /><br />- Verify some characters combined as you typed<br />- Press Enter to post",

        "expectedResult": "Both message and reply post as expected, with some characters combining as you type<br /><br />- Post should appear as:<br />안녕하세요<br /><br />Incorrect behavior: Input and/or post looks like this, with each keystroke appearing as an individual character:<br />ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹㅇㅣㅂㄹㅕㄱㅁㅜㄴㅈㅔ",
