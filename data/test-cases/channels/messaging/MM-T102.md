## MM-T102: Timestamp on edited post shows original post time

---

**Step 1**

Timestamp on edited post shows original post time\
\--------------------\
1\. Observe the timestamp on a non-edited post\
2\. Edit the post\
3\. Hover over the timestamp of that post\
4\. Click Reply to open the message in the RHS as well

**Expected**

Hovering over a timestamp shows a full date tooltip in both center and RHS.\
\
The time should match with the original posting time, not when the post was edited.
