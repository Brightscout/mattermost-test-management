---

**Step 1**

Floating timestamp in mobile view (in browser/desktop)\
\--------------------\
\
\*\* Test this on community-release.mattermost.com so you can see some older data \*\*\
\
\*\* DESKTOP APP: Narrow to mobile view for this test, then back to standard view to continue testing \*\*\
\
1\. Narrow your browser or desktop app so it goes into mobile view\
2\. View a channel that has at least several days of messages\
3\. Scroll up in the channel, observe the floating timestamp / date indicator

**Test Data**

Test this on community-release.mattermost.com

**Expected**

Floating date indicator should change the date to reflect the messages being viewed
