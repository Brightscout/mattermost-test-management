## MM-T179: Channel is removed from Unreads section if user navigates out of it via permalink

---

**Step 1**

Channel is removed from Unreads section if user navigates out of it via permalink\
\--------------------\
1\. As UserA copy the permalink of a post in any channel and paste it into another test channel mentioning UserB in the post\
2\. As UserB, open the unread channel that has a permalink to a post in another channel\
2\. As UserB, click on the permalink

**Expected**

UserB is taken to the linked post and the channel that UserB navigated away from is removed from "Unreads" section
