## MM-T114: Delete a GIF from RHS reply thread, other user viewing in center and RHS sees GIF preview disappear from both

---

**Step 1**

Delete a GIF from RHS reply thread, other user viewing in center and RHS sees GIF preview disappear from both\
\--------------------\
If testing on mobile, have User 2 view on mobile and User 1 posting on whatever you like\
\
User 1 posts:\
1\) Post a message, and a reply to that message\
2\) Post another reply that contains the following:\
\
https\://media1.giphy.com/media/l41lM6sJvwmZNruLe/giphy.gif\
\
User 2 views:\
3\) View the message thread posted in steps 1-2, both in the center channel and right-hand sidebar (mobile just view reply thread, aka the \`Message Details\` screen)\
\
User 1 deletes:\
4\) Delete the reply posted in step 2 (the giphy link; the second reply)

**Expected**

\- Second reply including GIF (posted in 2) disappears from center channel and RHS (mobile verify disappears from \`Message Details\` view)\
\
\- "(message deleted)" does not display for deleter\
\
\- (N/A for mobile apps:) On refresh, RHS closes

**Step 2**

Do the same test in compact mode.

**Expected**

Same as above
