### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Delete a GIF from RHS reply thread, other user viewing in center and RHS sees GIF preview disappear from both<br />--------------------<br />If testing on mobile, have User 2 view on mobile and User 1 posting on whatever you like<br /><br />User 1 posts:<br />1) Post a message, and a reply to that message<br />2) Post another reply that contains the following:<br /><br />https://media1.giphy.com/media/l41lM6sJvwmZNruLe/giphy.gif<br /><br />User 2 views:<br />3) View the message thread posted in steps 1-2, both in the center channel and right-hand sidebar (mobile just view reply thread, aka the `Message Details` screen)<br /><br />User 1 deletes:<br />4) Delete the reply posted in step 2 (the giphy link; the second reply)</article>

**Expected**

> <article>- Second reply including GIF (posted in 2) disappears from center channel and RHS (mobile verify disappears from `Message Details` view)<br /><br />- &quot;(message deleted)&quot; does not display for deleter<br /><br />- (N/A for mobile apps:) On refresh, RHS closes</article>
