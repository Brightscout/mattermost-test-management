## MM-T111: RHS should NOT show Saved Posts and Recent Mentions in a PRIVATE channel the user was removed from

---

**Step 1**

RHS does NOT show Saved Posts and Recent Mentions in a private channel the user was removed from (applies to all user types)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in as two test users and navigate to the same private channel for each user
2. **UserA** flags a post in the private channel
3. **UserB** mentions UserA in the private channel
4. **UserA** opens Saved Posts or Recent Mentions in RHS
5. The Saved post and the post mentioning **UserA** are shown in RHS
6. **UserB** removes UserA from the same private channel

**Expected**

- **UserA** sees a notification that **UserB** removed him from the channel
- RHS no longer shows Saved posts or recent mentions from that private channel
