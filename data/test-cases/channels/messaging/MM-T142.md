## MM-T142: Pinning or un-pinning older message does not cause it to display at bottom of channel(newline)(newline)Pinned posts display in RHS with newest at top

---

**Step 1**

Pinning or un-pinning older message does not cause it to display at bottom of channel\
\
Pinned posts display in RHS with newest at top\
\--------------------\
1\. Ensure there are a couple pinned posts in the channel already\
2\. Scroll up in the channel to find an older post\
3\. Click \[...] > Pin to channel For mobile, long press\
4\. Scroll down and verify that message you just pinned does not display at bottom in center channel (as newest in channel)\
5\. Click pin icon to view pinned posts in RHS, verify sorted by newest at top (mobile apps: tap channel name to find Pinned Posts menu option)\
6\. Scroll back up to the post you pinned in step 3 (or up to any older pinned post)\
7\. Click \[...] > Un-pin from channel for Mobile long press

**Expected**

When pinned, older message should retain its position in the center channel and should not move down to display as newest message (at the bottom)\
\
Pinned posts RHS should display with newest at top\
\
When un-pinned in center, post disappears from pinned posts list in RHS
