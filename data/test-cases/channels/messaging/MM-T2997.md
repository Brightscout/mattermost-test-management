## MM-T2997: System message for @mention-ing a user who is not in channel using at-mention followed by the special character

---

**Step 1**

System message for @mention-ing a user who is not in channel using at-mention followed by the special character\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. @ mention a user(s) that is not a current member of the channel following with any of the characters \[. , ; : ! ? etc]
   \
   e.g. @username. or @user\_name!

- ["only visible to you" tag is not aligned correctly — MM-17340](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17340)
- [If an at-mention is followed by a period, and they are not in the channel, you don't get a "this user didn't get notified" system message — MM-23211](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23211)

**Expected**

- Only visible to you" tag is next to the timestamp
- System message includes all the users not currently in the channel:
  \
  "@username and @user\_name did not get notified by this mention because they are not in the channel. Would you like to add them to this private channel? They will have access to all message history."
