### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Filtering by first name with Korean characters<br>--------------------<br>(Hardware Korean keyboard not required)<br>1. Set a user's first name to the following (copy and paste into first name field in Account Settings &gt; General):<br><br>정트리나/trina.jung/집단사무국(CO)<br><br>2. Log in as another user (user2) and view a channel you and user1 are both in, plus other users as well<br>3. Set your keyboard language to 2-Set Korean (steps vary by OS)<br>4. Type `@` and the beginning of the other user's first name like so:<br>- From a keyboard with English printed on the keys but set to output in Korean, typing (not pasting) the following letters after the `@` should produce the correct characters:<br><br>wjdxmflsk</article>

**Expected**

> <article>- Autocomplete list does filters to only display user(s) that match the string<br /><br />  - The matching user is highlighted<br /><br />  - Pressing Tab autofills the message box with the matching user's username, and pressing Enter posts the mention</article>

**Step Info**
| Name | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Important notes about this step | Cannot test on RN exactly as described, since no 2-set korean keyboard. But possible to compose CJK on Standard Korean keyboard and verify getting @-mentions correctly. Can add back to RN apps w/automation if possible |
