## MM-T183: Filtering by first name with Korean characters

---

**Step 1**

Filtering by first name with Korean characters\
\--------------------\
(Hardware Korean keyboard not required)\
1\. Set a user's first name to the following (copy and paste into first name field in Account Settings > General):\
\
정트리나/trina.jung/집단사무국(CO)\
\
2\. Log in as another user (user2) and view a channel you and user1 are both in, plus other users as well\
3\. Set your keyboard language to 2-Set Korean (steps vary by OS)\
4\. Type \`@\` and the beginning of the other user's first name like so:\
\- From a keyboard with English printed on the keys but set to output in Korean, typing (not pasting) the following letters after the \`@\` should produce the correct characters:\
\
wjdxmflsk

**Expected**

\- Autocomplete list does filters to only display user(s) that match the string\
\
\- The matching user is highlighted\
\
\- Pressing Tab autofills the message box with the matching user's username, and pressing Enter posts the mention
