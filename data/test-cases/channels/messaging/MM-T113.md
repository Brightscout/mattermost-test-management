<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Delete a Message during reply, other user sees `(message deleted)`<br />--------------------<br />1. Have another user post a message in a channel you can see<br />2. Click the reply arrow to *start* to reply to the message (but do not post the reply; just view the reply thread and start to type a reply in the reply box)<br />3. Have the other user delete the message they posted, [...] &gt; Delete<br />4. After the other user has deleted the parent message, press Enter to send your reply<br />5. Observe the modal that appears, then click `Okay` to close it (leave RHS open)<br />6. Enter another reply and press Enter or tap to send</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Your view:<br />The deleted parent post shows as (message deleted). <br />When try to post the reply anyway, a modal (FYI specifically the PostDeletedModal) is shown that tells you &quot;Someone deleted the message on which you tried to post a comment.&quot; The RHS / reply thread should remain open, and the reply draft remains in text box.<br /><br />The other user, who deleted the message, should not see &quot;(message deleted)&quot; in any way because of your unsent reply<br /><br />When you close the warning modal and try to send a second reply, the modal appears again.</article>
