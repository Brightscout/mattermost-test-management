## MM-T3318: Posting GIFs

---

**Step 1**

1. Post the following link\
   https\://media1.tenor.com/images/4627c6507cdc899d211319081ba5740b/tenor.gif
2. Post another link\
   https\://media.giphy.com/media/XIqCQx02E1U9W/giphy.gif

**Expected**

On 1, GIF renders as an image preview and is animated.\
On 2, The client renders an image with image dimensions it receives from the server. **Note**: In other words, it displays in the same size as pasting that link in a new tab would display it at instead of a small thumbnail.
