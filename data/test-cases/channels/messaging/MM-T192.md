<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>RN apps: Wide markdown table will truncate and display properly when tapped on<br />--------------------<br />1. From a browser/desktop app, copy, paste, and post the text from the attached note in a channel (will render as a large table)<br /><br />2. View the post from the RN app</article>

**Test Data**

> <article>(Note: Open ticket to improve discoverability of being able to tap on the markdown table to open full screen view https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14199 - fixed)</article>

**Expected**

> <article>In RN apps: Table is truncated on right and bottom edges, and has slight gradient shading down the right-hand-side as well as along the bottom edge to indicate there is more content off-screen - similar to long posts (show more/less) <br />There is an expand button added to improve discoverability of opening in full screen.(MM-14199)<br /><br />Tapping on the table will open full table view and in that view:<br /><br />On Android, you can scroll vertically and horizontally as needed to view the entire table (Android does not support diagonal scrolling so you can only scroll horizontally and then vertically.)<br /><br />On iOS, you can scroll diagonally / in any direction to view the entire table</article>
