## MM-T1630: "Jump" to convo works every time for a conversation

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to your @mentions from the top bar
2. In any thread that appears on the RHS, click on "Jump"
3. The linked conversation appears in the center channel
4. In the center channel, scroll up to view older chats such that the originally linked conversation moves below the viewable area
5. On the RHS click "Jump" again for the same conversation

**Expected**

- Clicking on jump in step 5 takes you back to the conversation in the center channel again (same as the message in step 3).
