## MM-T203: Focus does not move when it has already been set elsewhere

---

**Step 1**

Focus does not move when it has already been set elsewhere\
\--------------------\
1\. From the channel menu, select Add Channel Member\
2\. Note the modal opens and the focus moves to the search box\
3\. Push a character key such as "A"\
4\. Click anywhere in the modal that is not on a field that can take focus\
5\. Note the focus has been removed from the search box\
6\. Push a character key such as "A"

**Expected**

3\. Keystroke is captured in the search box\
6\. Focus is not moved anywhere. Neither the search box or main input box has the focus
