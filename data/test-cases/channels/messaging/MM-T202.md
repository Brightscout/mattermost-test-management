---

**Step 1**

Focus does not move for non-character keys\
\--------------------\
1\. Left click on a post to move the focus out of the main input box\
2\. Hit the following keys and watch to see if the focus is returned to the main input box: Num Lock, down arrow, Shift, F7, Pg Up(from numpad with num lock off), enter and a system key such as win or fn

**Expected**

For each keystroke the focus is not returned to the message input box
