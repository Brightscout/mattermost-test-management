**Step 1**

Focus move to main input box when a character key is selected\
\--------------------\
1\. Click the flag icon to open the flagged posts RHS to move the focus out of the main input box\
2\. Push a character key such as "A"\
3\. Click the @ icon to open the Recent mentions RHS to move the focus out of the main input box\
4\. Push a character key such as "A"

**Expected**

Anytime you push a character key such as "A" the focus is moved back to the main input and the keystroke is captured
