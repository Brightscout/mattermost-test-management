–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post message with multiple markdown tables (1, 2, 3, 4 and more columns) - (same as in step 1 above)
2. Tap expand button

**Expected**

1. Observe that Table view is shown.
2. Tables should fill the available view when 4 or less columns are present.
3. Columns should respect the max width.
4. 3-column table should fill the available view and respect the max column widths
5. No panning in this view. Tables should only be scrollable.
6. Verify the same behaviour both on portrait and landscape views
7. Cell with long text should wrap properly.
8. If the content wraps, the cells per row should grow taller and should enable vertical scrolling.
9. Tables should scroll when 4 or more columns are present depending on the device height. Small device should scroll at 4 columns while larger device at 5 or more.
10. When scrollable, scroll bar/s should always be visible for user to know more rows/columns.
