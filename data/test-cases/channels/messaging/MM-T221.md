## MM-T221: Posts should not change order when being sent quickly

---

**Step 1**

Posts change order when being sent quickly\
\--------------------\
1 - Post a series of numbers rapidly one after the other â€” i.e., Type 1, hit enter, type 2, hit enter, etc.

**Expected**

The posts don't reshuffle as you post but instead post in the order you sent them.
