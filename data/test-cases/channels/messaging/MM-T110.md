## MM-T110: Delete a parent message that has a reply: Reply RHS

---

**Step 1**

Delete a parent message that has a reply: Reply RHS\
\--------------------\
Mobile app:\
1\. Reply to a message\
2\. Return to center channel view\
3\. Delete parent post\
\
Non-mobile:\
1\. Reply to a message\
2\. Ensure reply thread in open in RHS\
3\. In center, click \[...] > Delete on the parent post

**Test Data**

Duplicate of following test - Leaving this row here because we put in HW for both; SA suggested making one of the Cypress tests for mobile view in order to use them both

**Expected**

Mobile: Verify both parent and reply disappear from channel\
\
Non-mobile:\
1\. Both parent post and reply are deleted and disappear from both center and RHS\
2\. Confirmation modal warns how many comments will be deleted\
3\. Deleter does not see `(message deleted)`
