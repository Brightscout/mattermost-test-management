### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Edit a message in permalink view<br />--------------------<br />1. Post a message containing a usefully searchable string such as &quot;searchtest&quot;<br />2. Type that string into the search box and press Enter<br />3. Click Jump in search results to jump to the permalink view of the message you had posted<br />4. Observe permalink view in center, click the three-dot menu and select Edit<br />5. Add some new text, ensuring that your search term remains intact (such as &quot;searchtest&quot;) and Save<br />6. As another user in another browser / device, do the same search, find the same message, and click Jump to view in permalink view</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Message is edited successfully, and &quot;(edited)&quot; should display at the end of the message for both users.</article>
