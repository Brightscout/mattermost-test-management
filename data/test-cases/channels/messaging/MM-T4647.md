## MM-T4647: Performance test - User with large number of DMs

---

**Step 1**

1. As user1 join a server with 1500+ users or generate them with `/test users 1500 1500`

2. (Optional) In a channel type \`\`\` /test channels 100 100\` \`\`, hit enter

3. In a channel type \`\`\` /test dms 1500 1500\` \`\`, hit enter

4. Join the same channel with user2 and only open few DMs

   1. Can either use the same browser (log out b/w users) or use a separate / incognito browser and observe user1 and user2 side-by-side

5. Close the tab(s) and wait 2-5 minutes

6. Re-open the tab and login as user1 - switch few channels, create few posts etc. -

   1. Verify server is usable, check for sluggishness
   2. After v6.5 - Open dev tools, search for "channel\_switch", load time should remain around 300ms or less

7. Logout as user1 (or use other browser / session)

8. Login as user2 (or use other browser / session), switch a few channels -

   1. Verify server is usable, there should not be any sluggishness and "channel\_switch" load time

**Expected**

- Verify users with high number of DMs are not experiencing any sluggishness
- "channel\_switch" load time should remain in <300ms ballpark
