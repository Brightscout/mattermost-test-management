<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Input box on reply thread can expand<br />--------------------<br />1. Place the focus in the Reply thread input box<br />2. Type a reply that is several lines long (can be done with whitespace)<br />3. As the post becomes longer note the input box becomes taller to accomodate the text</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Text box continues to expand for each new line until it reaches about 50%. The box then begins to scroll once its maximum height has been reached</article>
