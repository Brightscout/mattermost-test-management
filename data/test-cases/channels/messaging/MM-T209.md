## MM-T209: Input box on reply thread can expand

---

**Step 1**

Input box on reply thread can expand\
\--------------------\
1\. Place the focus in the Reply thread input box\
2\. Type a reply that is several lines long (can be done with whitespace)\
3\. As the post becomes longer note the input box becomes taller to accomodate the text

**Expected**

Text box continues to expand for each new line until it reaches about 50%. The box then begins to scroll once its maximum height has been reached
