## MM-T3152: RN apps: More Messages banner and New Messages line

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: More Messages banner and New Messages line\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As user 1, launch the mobile app.
2. Go to a channel where you can be mentioned.
3. Exit the app (\*\*close app, not just minimize – \*\***swipe up from the bottom of the screen and pause slightly in the middle of the screen, then swipe up to close**)
4. As user 2, post enough messages to the channel in step 2 so that when user 1 returns to that channel the first unread message will be outside the viewable area.
5. As user 2, mention user 1 in this same channel.
6. As user 1, tap on the received push notification.
7. Expected: As user 1 lands on the channel, the More Messages button may appear momentarily and animate away (if it appears and stays, it's fine).
8. As user 1, scroll up enough above the currently viewable screen, then mark another message as unread and exit the app.
9. As user2, mention user 1 in this same channel.
10. As user 1, tap on the received push notification.
11. Expected: The More Messages button is shown with the correct unread count.

**Expected**

- When a user opens any channel, user is always landed at the bottom of the channel
- If the channel is unread when opened and the New Messages line is on the screen (in the visible area), More Messages banner/button is not shown at all 
- If there are unread messages beyond the visible area, More Messages banner/button with a count of TOTAL unread messages. e.g. "XX new messages" is shown
- Tapping the banner/button should scroll the user to the oldest rendered post, and the banner count should update depending on how many MORE un-reads are above that location. The banner should read "XX more new messages"
- As soon as the "New Messages" line is visible on the screen, the banner should hide (animate away)

**Step 2**

Should still display New Messages line after app relaunch\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. On a channel, in the visible area, mark a post unread
2. Close the app then relaunch it

**Expected**

- On app relaunch user is back at the channel from step 2 and the New Messages line should still display.
