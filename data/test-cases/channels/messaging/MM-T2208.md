## MM-T2208: @ autocomplete - not in channel (RHS), have permission to add (private channel)

---

**Step 1**

@ autocomplete - not in channel (RHS), have permission to add (private channel)\
————————————————————————————\
As a user who has permission to add members to a channel:\
1\. Identify a user on the team who is not in the channel you're viewing\
2\. Open a reply thread RHS\
3\. In RHS, post `@\[thatusername]`\
4\. Ephemeral message displays "{user} was mentioned but is not in the channel. Would you like to add them to the channel? They will have access to all message history."\
5\. In RHS, click the link "add them to the channel"

**Expected**

Ephemeral message asking if you want to add the user disappears\
\
In RHS, added-user message shows as ephemeral (only visible to you)\
\
In center, added-user message shows as system message, not part of a reply thread
