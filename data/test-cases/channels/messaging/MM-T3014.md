**Step 1**

- Post some emoji with the skin tone suffixes\
  for example:

`:wave_medium_light_skin_tone:`\
`:wave_medium_skin_tone:`\
`:wave_medium_dark_skin_tone:`\
`:wave_dark_skin_tone:`

- Try adding skin tone suffixes to few other hand gestures (combination emojis like professions are not supported at this time)\
  `_light_skin_tone`\
  `_medium_light_skin_tone`\
  `_medium_skin_tone`\
