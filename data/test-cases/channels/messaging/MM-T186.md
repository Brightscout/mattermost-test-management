## MM-T186: Markdown preview: inline image

---

**Step 1**

1\. Markdown preview: inline image

- Type or copy a message with large inline image via markdown but don't send, such as:

\
!\[make it so]\(https\://i.stack.imgur.com/MNeE7.jpg)

- Switch to markdown preview by clicking on "Preview" from message input box

\
2\. Image size parameter should determine display size

- Post the markdown text, such as:

\
!\[Mattermost]\(https\://imgsv.imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/df/img/sample/img\_01.jpg =50x76 "Mattermost Icon")

**Expected**

On step 1:

- The message box should expand, just like it does, for example, with a list, so that image preview can be easily viewed.

\
On step 2:

- The image height and width are set to 50x76 - as outlined in the markdown parameters.
