## MM-T186: Markdown preview: inline image

---

**Step 1**

1\. Markdown preview: inline image\\

- Type or copy a message with large inline image via markdown but don't send, such as:

!\[make it so]\(https\://i.stack.imgur.com/MNeE7.jpg)

- Switch to markdown preview by clicking on "Preview" from message input box

2\. Image size parameter should determine display size\\

- Post the markdown text, such as:

!\[Mattermost]\(https\://imgsv.imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/df/img/sample/img\_01.jpg =50x76 "Mattermost Icon")

(Duplicate) [Image size parameter not working — MM-22303](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22303)

_Important notes about this step:_

- You may still have to scroll if the image doesn't fit into the height of the expanded message input box but you should not see just the image in a narrow slit with scrollbars.
- Also, the image shouldn't overlap with other markdown images. See https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18190 for more details.

**Expected**

On step 1:

- The message box should expand, just like it does, for example, with a list, so that image preview can be easily viewed.

On step 2:\\

- The image height and width are set to 50x76 - as outlined in the markdown parameters.
