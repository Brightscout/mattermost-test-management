1. Using two test accounts, create a conversation of a parent post and 5 or so replies (or use conversation created above)
2. From the center channel, flag the parent post and then click on the "saved posts" icon to open saved posts in the RHS (observe at this stage that reply count is correct in center channel)
3. In the RHS reply to the flagged parent post
4. Without closing the RHS after you posted a reply in 3) click on the "saved posts" icon again
