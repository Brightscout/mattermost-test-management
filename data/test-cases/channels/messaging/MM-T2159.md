## MM-T2159: RHS shows flagged posts across channels

---

**Step 1**

RHS shows flagged posts across channels\
————————————————————————————\
Note for mobile: Flag and unflag using three-dot menu on message\
1\. Flag a post in channel1\
2\. Flag a post in channel2\
3\. Flag another post in channel2\
4\. Click the flag icon to the right of the search box

**Expected**

All flagged messages appear in RHS flagged posts list, with channel name displayed above each flagged post in RHS (but not from different teams; not testing that here)
