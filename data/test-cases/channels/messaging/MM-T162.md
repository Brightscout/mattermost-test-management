## MM-T162: Emojis show as jumbo in reply thread

---

**Step 1**

Emojis show as jumbo in reply thread\
\--------------------\
1\. Click reply on any post\
2\. In the input box of the reply thread make a post that consists of only a few emojis and no text (use the emoji picker or keyboard)

**Expected**

Emojis show as jumbo\
\
(there is no limit to how many emoji you can post in a message on webapp/desktop \[the limit is 4 on RN] and both emoji in the picker and custom emoji should render jumbo)\
