### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Emojis show as jumbo in reply thread<br />--------------------<br />1. Click reply on any post<br />2. In the input box of the reply thread make a post that consists of only a few emojis and no text (use the emoji picker or keyboard)</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Emojis show as jumbo<br /><br />(there is no limit to how many emoji you can post in a message on webapp/desktop [the limit is 4 on RN] and both emoji in the picker and custom emoji should render jumbo)<br />Implementation ticket: https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-11956</article>
