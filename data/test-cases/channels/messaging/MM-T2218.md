## MM-T2218: Emoji - alias autocomplete

---

**Step 1**

Emoji - alias autocomplete\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Ensure there is an emoji with an original name plus an alias name, such as :+1: and :thumbsup: both posting the same emoji (can create your own if easier, just use same image and upload it two different times with different names)\
2\. Type the first few characters of emoji name, select autocomplete emoji, and post\
3\. Type the first few characters of that emoji's alias, select autocomplete emoji, and post

**Expected**

Autocomplete should offer the correct emoji for both its original name and its alias
