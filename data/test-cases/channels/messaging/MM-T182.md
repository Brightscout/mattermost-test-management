### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Typing using CJK keyboard<br />--------------------<br />NOTE: If you need help, please ask QA and we'll help. :) (Googling for your particular environment can be really helpful as well)<br /><br />1. Switch your keyboard to a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean keyboard (settings vary by OS)<br />- In general: Should be able to add in System / Keyboard settings, then view Mattermost, then click or tap keyboard settings icon to toggle it<br /><br />2. Type characters in message box and post; you will likely see some characters combining as you type, and that is the expected behavior<br />3. Open reply to that message, type a reply, post the reply<br /><br />If you want to repro a specific Korean example:<br />- Set keyboard to use 2-Set Korean<br />- Type the following sequence of letters (do not copy/paste): <br /><br />dkssuggktpdy<br /><br />- Verify some characters combined as you typed<br />- Press Enter to post</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Both message and reply post as expected, with some characters combining as you type<br /><br />- Post should appear as:<br />안녕하세요<br /><br />Incorrect behavior: Input and/or post looks like this, with each keystroke appearing as an individual character:<br />ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹㅇㅣㅂㄹㅕㄱㅁㅜㄴㅈㅔ</article>

| Important notes about this step | (Issues had been coming up frequently; good to be able to test each time on Chrome and RN apps)<br /><br />Can't test on desktop app due to no East Asian IME available |
