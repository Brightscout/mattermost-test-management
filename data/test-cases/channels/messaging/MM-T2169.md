---

**Step 1**

————————————————————————————\
1\. On a message containing "hello" in center channel, click \[...] > Pin to channel\
2\. Search for "hello"\
3\. In center channel, click \[...] > Un-pin from channel

**Expected**

After step 3: Post still appears in RHS search results, but Pinned badge is removed
