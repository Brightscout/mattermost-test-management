## MM-T219: Recent mentions search should fully expand in tablet view

---

**Step 1**

Recent mentions search doesn't fully expand in tablet view until results are fully loaded\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Sign in to Mattermost on a browser and shrink the window to about halfway horizontally so that it displays in tablet view (between full view and narrow mobile view)
2. Click the "@"-icon to open recent mentions search
