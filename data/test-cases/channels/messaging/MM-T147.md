## MM-T147: Multiple reactions list names of users on hover

---

**Step 1**

Multiple reactions list names of users on hover\
\--------------------\
Test on a server like \*\*community-release.mattermost.com\*\* where you can find a post with multiple people adding the same reaction to a post; can try this one:\
<https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/pl/qpn1tom69f8kdyua4mikduyy1o>\
\
1\. Find a post where >5 people have added the same reaction to a post\
2\. Hover over the reaction

**Expected**

The users who added that reaction are listed in the tooltip by recency (not alphabetical)\
\
Text wraps inside the hover popover, rather than extending way out to the right
