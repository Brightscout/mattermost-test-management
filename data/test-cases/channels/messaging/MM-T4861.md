## MM-T4861: Show single image thumbnail in standard mode

---

**Step 1**

Show single image thumbnail in standard mode

1. Login and visit Town Square channel

2. Set the message display setting to standard i.e. not compact

3. Upload an image

4. Post it with a message

5. Get to last post's message

   1. Check if the typed message appeared in the post
   2. Check that we don't show the image name
   3. Check if image appearsÂ 
   4. Check if collapse/expand button appeared, since it's an icon button without text, finding it by aria label, as that's what the screenreader will call out
   5. Check the image height property is 350px
