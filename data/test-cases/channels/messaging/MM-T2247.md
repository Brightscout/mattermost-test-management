## MM-T2247: Markdown link previews

---

**Step 1**

Markdown link previews\
————————————————————————————\
1\. (Mobile apps do this step in a browser) Ensure System Console > Link Previews > "Enable Link Previews" is set to true\
2\. Ensure Account Settings > Advanced > Preview community-release.mattermost.com features > link previews = enabled\
3\. Post the following:\
/test url test-link-preview\
into a channel\
4\. Read through the resulting post\
\
Okay when testing on mobile app to make posts in browser if easier, then verify in mobile app that they render as expected

**Expected**

All link previews render as described in the post.\
\
Added comment in IDE to verify in RHS with comments / multiple links posted as well (updated 4.4): all previews should display, not just parent post
