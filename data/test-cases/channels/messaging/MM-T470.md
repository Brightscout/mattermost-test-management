## MM-T470: Reply in existing GM

---

**Step 1**

1\. User1 in a GM posts a message\
2\. User2 in that GM clicks the Reply arrow on the message\
3\. User2 sees RHS / reply screen open with parent post at the top and a reply box\
4\. User2 types a reply and clicks / taps to send or presses Enter

**Expected**

User1 and User2 see reply posted:\
\- Center channel at the bottom\
\- User2 in RHS also\
\
("RHS" in RN apps is just the reply thread screen)
