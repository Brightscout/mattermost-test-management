## MM-T212: Leave a long draft in reply input box and view on return

---

**Step 1**

Leave a long draft in reply input box\
\--------------------\
1\. Open the reply thread for a post\
2\. Type a post that is several lines long but do not post it (can be done with whitespace)\
3\. As the post becomes longer note the input box becomes taller to accomodate the text\
4\. Open the reply thread for a a different post in the channel\
5\. Re-open the reply thread from step 1

**Expected**

Input box height has not changed
