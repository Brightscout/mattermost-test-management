## MM-T2505: Users are auto-completed in message input box by username

**Objective**

Users are auto-completed as expected, by username, nickname, firstname, lastname (e.g. I can search for `isherwood` and `lindy.isherwood` will be returned)

---

**Step 1**

Note: This test requires Elasticsearch to be enabled - autocomplete, indexing and searching.\
\
Full username returns single user\

1. In a message input box, type "@username" of a user you want to mention
