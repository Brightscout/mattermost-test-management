## MM-T4082: DM can be opened with a user not on your team or in your DM channel sidebar

---

**Step 1**

Note: This test requires Elasticsearch and Bleve to be disabled.\
\
DM can be opened with a user not on your team or in your DM channel sidebar\
————————————————————————————

1. Open the Direct Messages modal clicking on the "+" sign at the right of the "Direct Messages" header on the channel list.
2. Search for a user who doesn't belong to any of the channels / DMs / GMs that you belong to (so their profile is not loaded).

**Expected**

- Their profile should be returned correctly as part of the search and they should appear in the result list.
- You should be able to create a DM / GM with them
