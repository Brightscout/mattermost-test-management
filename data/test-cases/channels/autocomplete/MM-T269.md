## MM-T269: Slow Connection - No matches for channel autocomplete (e.g. ~channelname)

**Precondition**

Run these tests on <https://mysql.test.mattermost.com/>

---

**Step 1**

No matches for channel autocomplete (e.g. \~channelname)\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to a chat or channel
2. Simulate a slow network connection to ease reproducing. (e.g. Chrome DevTools ➜ Network Tab ➜ Slow 3G)
3. Type "\~doesnotexist" and immediately press enter.

**Expected**

- The post "\~doesnotexist" is created and sent, unless `CTRL+ENTER` is enabled (Settings ➜ Advanced ➜ Send messages on CTRL+Enter), which then just adds a new line to the draft after the typed text.
