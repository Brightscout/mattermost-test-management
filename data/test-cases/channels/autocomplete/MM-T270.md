## MM-T270: Slow Connection - No matches for user autocomplete (e.g. @username)

**Precondition**

# Run these tests on <https://mysql.test.mattermost.com/>

---

**Step 1**

No matches for user autocomplete (e.g. @username)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Simulate a slow network connection to ease reproducing. (e.g. Chrome DevTools ➜ Network Tab ➜ Slow 3G)
2. Type "@doesnotexist" and immediately press enter.

**Expected**

- The post "@doesnotexist" is created and sent, unless \`CTRL+ENTER\` is enabled (Settings ➜ Advanced ➜ Send messages on CTRL+Enter), which then just adds a new line to the draft after the typed text.
