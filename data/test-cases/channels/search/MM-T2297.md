## MM-T2297: Arrows move through auto-complete options but do not select

---

**Step 1**

Arrows move through auto-complete options but do not select\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Search for `from:` followed by a space (or any beginning of username that results in multiple auto-complete options)\
2\. Press down and up arrow keys to move through list

**Expected**

1\. Highlighted option changes\
2\. An option is not selected, so search term stays incomplete
