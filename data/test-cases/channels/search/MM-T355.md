---

**Step 1**

Old search results are not combined with new search results\
\--------------------\
\*\* Test on community-release.mattermost.com:\*\*\
\
1\. Search for `support in:developers`\
2\. Scroll several pages worth (noting the messages as you go)\
3\. Then search for `faq in:developers`\
4\. Scroll several pages (noting the messages as you go)

**Expected**

After 3) you should NOT see results from the search in step 1) appearing in the search results
