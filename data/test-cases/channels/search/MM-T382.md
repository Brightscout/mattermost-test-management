## MM-T382: With search RHS open, scroll up in center to load older messages

---

**Step 1**

With search RHS open, scroll up in center to load older messages\
\--------------------\
1\. In a channel with more than one "page's" worth of messages (can post `/test posts 40` to create 40 posts if needed):\
2\. Search for a term that will have results (e.g. `test` on most servers) and leave RHS open\
3\. In center, scroll up to trigger older messages loading, keeping an eye on the dates as more messages load\
4\. Continue to scroll up in center a few more times to trigger a couple more "batches" of messages to load

**Expected**

Messages load smoothly and in correct chronological order in center\
\
No change in search results RHS
