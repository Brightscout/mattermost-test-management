\
After step 4,

- You should be able to scroll through autocomplete list in search using mouse/touchpad, as well as using up/down keyboard shortcuts.
- Selected item is added to search box on Enter

\
After step 5,

- The autocomplete vanishes and is replaced by the search hint list 

\
After step 7,

- A space is added to the end of the search string
- The autocomplete vanishes
- Pressing enter again will perform the search
- Selecting the suggested channel from the list will also close the autocomplete list

\
After step 8,

- Autocomplete suggestions show both the channel name alone as well as in parenthesis\
  (e.g., "in:town square \~town-square")

\
After step 9,

- \`in:\[channel name]\` is added to the search box alone as shown below and not the hyphenated name (e.g., "in:town square \~town-square") that you observed in the list as it populated while you typed.
