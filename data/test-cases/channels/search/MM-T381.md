## MM-T381: Search results RHS: Delete a parent post

---

**Step 1**

Search results RHS: Delete a parent post\
\--------------------\
1\. Post message `Test message`\
2\. Reply to that message with `Replying to test message`\
3\. Search for `test message`\
4\. In search results, find the parent post and click Delete and confirm

**Expected**

Both parent post and reply are deleted from RHS and center (in mobile, you won't see them simultaneously, of course, but make sure the message and reply do not appear in search results or center after deleting)
