## MM-T2298: @ icon displays @-mentions of current user: (newline)- Public channel(newline)- DM(newline)- GM(newline)(newline)@ icon does not display @channel messages

---

**Step 1**

@ icon displays @-mentions of current user:\
\- Public channel\
\- DM\
\- GM\
\
@ icon does not display @channel messages\
————————————————————————————\
Mobile apps:\
1\. Post a message that @-mentions your username (you can post it yourself)\
2\. Menu > Recent Mentions\
\
\
Non-Mobile (will test using a second user on the team):\
1\. Post in Off-Topic:\
\`@\[user2] greetings\`\
2\. Open a DM with the second user and post \`@\[user2] direct\` in DM\
3\. Open a GM with second user and any third user and post \`Group message @\[user2]\` in GM\
4\. Find a channel user2 is in (but not Off-Topic) and post:\
\`@channel\`\
5\. Log out and back in as user2\
6\. user2 clicks @ icon

**Expected**

Mobile apps:\
Just verify that UI looks good and the at-mention is returned in RHS and highlighted\
\
\
\
\
\
Non-Mobile:\
1\. RHS opens and displays all three mention posts, with \`@\[user2]\` highlighted\
2\. @channel message does not display in RHS\
3\. \`@here\` is not displayed in search box nor included in search results
