## MM-T2298: @ icon displays @-mentions of current user: - Public channel - DM - GM @ icon does not display @channel messages

---

**Step 1**

@ icon displays @-mentions of current user:\
\- Public channel\
\- DM\
\- GM\
\
@ icon does not display @channel messages\
————————————————————————————\
Mobile apps:\
1\. Post a message that @-mentions your username (you can post it yourself)\
2\. Menu > Recent Mentions\
\
\
Non-Mobile (will test using a second user on the team):\
1\. Post in Off-Topic:\
`@\[user2] greetings`\
2\. Open a DM with the second user and post `@\[user2] direct` in DM\
3\. Open a GM with second user and any third user and post `Group message @\[user2]` in GM\
4\. Find a channel user2 is in (but not Off-Topic) and post:\
`@channel`\
5\. Log out and back in as user2\
6\. user2 clicks @ icon

**Expected**

Mobile apps:\
Just verify that UI looks good and the at-mention is returned in RHS and highlighted\
\
\
\
\
\
Non-Mobile:\
1\. RHS opens and displays all three mention posts, with `@\[user2]` highlighted\
2\. @channel message does not display in RHS\
3\. `@here` is not displayed in search box nor included in search results
