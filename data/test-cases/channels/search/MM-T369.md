### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Search icon at narrower widths (as opposed to search box)<br />--------------------<br />1. Narrow your browser or desktop app width just enough so the search box is replaced by the search icon. <br />(FYI this will only happen if the RHS is closed and no text is in the search field)<br />2. Click the search icon, observe search box expands, focus is in search box, help text popover displays<br />3. Type text in the search box and press Enter to perform the search, observe search box stays same size<br />4. Close search results RHS</article>

**Expected**

> <article>After typing and pressing Enter, search box stays expanded (same size)<br /><br />After closing the RHS, search box collapses and search icon displays</article>
