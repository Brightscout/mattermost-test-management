## MM-T377: From:@user search, autocomplete (and does not match email address)

---

**Step 1**

From:@user search, autocomplete (and does not match email address)\
\--------------------\
1\. In search box, type \`from:@\` and the first couple letters of a user's name, but make sure the \`@\` is in there (For RN, Select the "From:" option)\
2\. Select a user from the autocomplete list\
3\. Press Enter

**Test Data**

Ticket to implement on RN apps: https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17135

**Expected**

Search box removes \`@\` and shows \`from:username\`\
\
Search results display of posts from that user\
\
Note: Expected that \`@user\` matches username \`@user-1\` but not email \`user\@sample.com\`
