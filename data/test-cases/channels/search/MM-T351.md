**Step 1**

1. Post the following:

   - /test url test-search
   - qwertyjkl

2. In a separate message, post the following:

   - qwerty

3. Type `test \*` `qwerty \*` in the search box and press Enter (space between the word and the asterisk)

**Expected**

Returns `qwerty` matches only, not 'qwertyjkl'
