## MM-T301: Changing the timezone in app settings updates post timestamps and date separators

**Precondition**

# Run these tests on <https://community-release.mattermost.com/>

---

**Step 1**

Changing the timezone in app settings updates post timestamps and date separators\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in to a server with experimental Timezone feature set to "True" in the system console (e.g. community-release)
2. Click on the three-dot menu and go to Settings ➜ Display ➜ Timezone
3. Disable "Set automatically"
4. Click "Change timezone" and select a timezone different from your actual one
5. Go back to a channel

**Expected**

- Post timestamps and post date separators are updated
- The date separators between posts (web and mobile) and the floating post timestamp in mobile web view should be updated to read Today or Yesterday for posts made on those days.

---

**Step 2**

1. Enable "Set automatically" again and verify in channel
2. Log out and log back into a different server and verify timezone is set automatically
3. Visit a channel with previous dates (2 or more days ago)
4. Disable Automatic Timezone and set timezone **manually** to NZ-Chat

**Expected**

After #2,

- Timezone should be set automatically to users location

After #4,

- Should display date in 'ddd, MMM D, YYYY' format
