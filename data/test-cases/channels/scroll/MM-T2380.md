**Step 1**

Look for scroll pop (known issues)\
————————————————————————————

1. Scroll to the top of all currently loaded posts
2. Wait for the application to display the loading indicator that more posts are loading
3. Repeat these 2 steps a few times

**Expected**

- When the next group of posts is loaded in the vertical position of the channel should stay near the last post you read
