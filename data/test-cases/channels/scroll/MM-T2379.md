## MM-T2379: No Performance issues or channel locking

---

**Step 1**

No Performance issues or channel locking\
————————————————————————————

1. Open a channel with a very long content history that has many images (Reception)
2. Begin scrolling up and watch as the application pauses to load the next set of posts

**Expected**

- More posts should continue to load as need
- The user should always see a loading indicator when the application pauses to load more posts
