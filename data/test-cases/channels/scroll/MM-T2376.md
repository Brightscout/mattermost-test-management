---

**Step 1**

Performance Tests; Channels not yet loaded into server cache load quickly\
————————————————————————————

1. On a server with a lot of data, open various channels that have likely not been viewed by anyone recently

**Expected**

- When the user opens a channel, the "Loading..." indicator not shown for an unusually long time. (5 or 10 seconds would be overly long)
