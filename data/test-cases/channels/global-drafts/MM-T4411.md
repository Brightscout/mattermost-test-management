## MM-T4411: Global Drafts > Display DM & GM drafts across teams

---

**Step 1**

1. Open a DM with User1 on Team1

2. Add some text without posting e.g. “pineapple”

   1. Verify global Drafts item is added to LHS, shows count 1
   2. Verify DM item on the LHS shows pencil draft icon on the right

3. Open a GM with 2 users on the same team, Team1

4. Add some text without posting e.g. “apple”

   1. Verify global Drafts item count increases to 2
   2. Verify GM item on the LHS shows pencil draft icon on the right

5. Join another team on the same server - Team2

6. Click on global Drafts

   1. Verify DM draft with User1 item is present
   2. Verify GM draft with 2 other users is present

**Expected**

- We display DM & GM drafts across teams, not only for current active team
