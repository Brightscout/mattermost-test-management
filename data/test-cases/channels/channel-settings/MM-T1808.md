## MM-T1808: Hover effect exists to add a channel description / header (when not already present)

---

**Step 1**

Hover effect exists to add a channel description / header (when not already present)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a new public channel
2. Hover over "Add a channel description" just below the channel name in the center channel  - ("Edit") should appear to the right when you hover
3. Click on "Add a channel description" after "(Edit)" appears
4. Add a description in the edit text input box and hit Enter
5. Hover your mouse over the channel description/header just below the channel name in the center channel

\
**Note**: Follow the steps again for a private channel, DM and GM — expected behavior is the same across all channels

**Expected**

- After you enter a channel description you should no longer see "(Edit)" appear to the right of the channel description/header when you hove and clicking does nothing.
- The header text you entered is displayed
