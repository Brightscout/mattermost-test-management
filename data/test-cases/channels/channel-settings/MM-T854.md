## MM-T854: RN apps: Load users in long Add Members list

---

**Step 1**

Load users in long Add Members list - RN apps\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\
On a server with enough users to fill several pages of scrolling (such as **mysql.test** or **community-release**):

1. Tap the channel header
2. Tap "Add Members"
3. Swipe up repeatedly (10+ times) to load more users in list

**Expected**

- Users should continue to load, without skipping any (should be obvious if it's skipping big chunks of users; also can compare to Add Members list on browser)
