## MM-T840: Channel member icon list - Displays and sorts by status

---

**Step 1**

On a channel with enough real users to see some real statuses:

1. Click channel member icon (top right by search)
2. Observe member list, verify as described ➜

- [Members list dropdown - says 457 members, only lists about 120 — MM-28298](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-28298)

_Important notes about this step:_

Best to test on community-release.mattermost.com, Reception or other channel with lots of users with different statuses

**Expected**

- Status icon displays on each profile picture\
  List is ordered by:

- Online status first, in alphabetical:\
  Make sure alphabetical list seems to cover the whole alphabet, rather than stopping midway through and jumping to next status

  - Then Away, alphabetical
  - Then DND, alphabetical
  - Then Offline, alphabetical
