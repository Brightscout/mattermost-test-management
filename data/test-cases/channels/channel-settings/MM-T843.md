## MM-T843: Not able to reply to a message from the RHS once removed from the channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Log in as two test users and navigate to the same channel for each user
2. UserA click on reply icon on a post to open the RHS
3. UserA leaves RHS open and navigates to another channel in the center panel
4. UserB removes UserA from the channel that is open in the RHS in 2)

[Able to reply to a post from RHS after being removed from a channel â€” MM-14198](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14198)

_Important notes about this step:_

RHS will only close if the thread or pinned posts being viewed are for the channel the user was removed from. In all other instances the RHS should remain open.

**Expected**

- RHS should close if it's open to a thread from the channel they were just removed from
