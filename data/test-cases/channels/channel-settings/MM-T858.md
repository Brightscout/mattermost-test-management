### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Combined join/leave messages in public channel:<ul><li>Combines until there is an intervening post</li><li>Multiple users in one type of action displays an "others" link the user can click to see full list of users</li></ul>Combined messages are listed in a fixed order based on action type, regardless of the order in which they happened:<ul><li>Joined</li><li>Was added</li><li>Left</li><li>Was removed</li></ul>--------------------<br>You'll need 5 test users you can add/remove, but you only need to be able to log in as one of them (user4 in step 4):<br><br><ol><li>Add any 3 users to a public channel (we'll call them user1, user2, user3)</li><li>Observe system message " and 2 others were added to the channel by you", and "and 2 others" is a link (but don't click it yet, or if you already did, refresh to re-collapse it)</li><li>Remove one of ^those users from the channel (user1)</li><li>Have yet another user (not one of the above) log in in another browser and join that channel themselves (user4)</li><li>Post a message in the channel to interrupt the join/leave messages</li><li>You add yet another user (not one of the above users) to the channel (user5)</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>Observe the following three posts<br>(how the username/first-last/nickname displays can vary based on Account Settings, but they should at least combine in this way):<ol><li>System<ul><li>@user4 joined the channel</li><li>@user1 and 2 others were added to the channel by you</li><li>&lt;2 others is a link that shows the others when clicked: user2, user3&gt;</li><li>@user1 (or 2 or 3) was removed from the channel.</li></ul></li><li>&lt;the test message you posted&gt;</li><li>System<ul><li>@user5 added to the channel by you.</li></ul></li></ol></article>
