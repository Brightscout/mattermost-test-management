### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article><strong>With enough channels in the LHS to scroll</strong>:<ol><li>Ensure Settings &gt; Sidebar does NOT have Unreads section enabled (or test on server that doesn't have that feature enabled to begin with)</li><li>Have another user post messages in a channel near the top of your channel list</li><li>Scroll LHS down and observe "More unreads" (RN apps have an up arrow instead of "above")</li><li>Click the indicator and observe it scrolls the LHS up</li><li>Have another user post in a channel near the bottom (or a DM)</li><li>Scroll LHS up and observe "More unreads" indicator</li><li>Click the indicator and observe it scrolls the LHS down</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>Clicking the unreads indicator should scroll your LHS so it's positioned a little bit (15px) past the channel with the unreads</li></ul></article>
