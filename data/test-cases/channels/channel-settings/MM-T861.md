## MM-T861: Closing create modal does not join a channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Open or join a public channel
2. Leave that channel
3. Click "+" to open the channel creation modal and add any title (RN tap "CREATE" and add a name)
4. Click Cancel, or tap the back arrow and tap `x` on RN, to close the modal without creating the new channel

**Expected**

- When modal closes the user does not rejoin the channel you had just left
