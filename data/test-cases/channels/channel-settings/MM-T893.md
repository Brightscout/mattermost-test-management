## MM-T893: Manage Members content changes when role is changed

---

**Step 1**

1. As a Channel Admin (**User1**) login on one browser and navigate to channel A and click on Manage Members,
2. As a Channel Member (**User2**) login on another browser and navigate to same channel A and click on Manage/View Members.
3. **User2** does not sees any option to change roles for any of the users since the user is just a member.
4. **User1** updates the role of **User2** and makes the user a Channel Admin.
5. Instantly without any browser refresh, the changes should be propagated and **User2** should now see the option to change roles of other users
6. Similarly now **User1** updates the role of **User2** and makes the user a Channel Member.
7. **User2** should now not see any option to change roles of other users.
