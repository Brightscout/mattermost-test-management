## MM-T846: Muted channels with mentions are now listed at the bottom of other mentions and above any unreads without mentions.

**Step 1**

1. Log in on RN app (you'll need to have a second test account on the same server/team/channels)
2. Open channel sidebar and select or create a public or private channel
3. Tap channel name, tap Mute channel
4. Go back to channel, observe bell with line through it appears at top next to channel name
5. Open channel sidebar, open or create a GM that includes another test user you can log in as
6. Tap GM channel name, tap Mute channel
7. Go back to channel, open channel sidebar, and select any other channel you didn't just mute
8. Have another user log in on another device / browser, and post at-mentions for you in the both of the two channels you muted
9. Have the other user also post an at-mention for you in a channel you did not mute
10. Have the other user post at least one regular message without a mention in it as well
11. 1View the channel sidebar on your first account (the one who muted the channels and was mentioned)

**Expected**

Unreads in the channel sidebar are sorted in the following order:

1. Non-muted channels with mentions
2. Muted channels with mentions
3. Remaining unread channels

\
(All 3 sections of Unreads are sorted alphabetically when they contain multiple channels)\
\
Can also tap through to read a couple channels: No unusual shifting happens while reading the channels
