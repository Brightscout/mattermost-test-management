## MM-T885: Channel notifications: Desktop notifications

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to Settings > Notifications > Desktop notifications, select "For all activity", Save
2. View a channel, click Channel name drop-down > Notification Preferences
3. Click Edit on "Send Desktop Notifications"
4. Select "Only for mentions" and click "Save"
5. Switch to viewing a different channel
6. Have another user post in the channel where you set the notification preferences (NO mention, and while you're not viewing the channel)
7. Observe there is no desktop notification
8. Have another user mention you in the channel where you set the notification preferences (while you're still not viewing the channel)

_Important notes about this step:_

Make sure one window isn't in Incognito because you may not receive the desktop notification based on the settings.

**Expected**

- Desktop notification appears after the at-mention only
- Ensure that mention badge is right-aligned in the channel list, so it appears along the right edge of the LHS (as opposed to directly following the channel name)
