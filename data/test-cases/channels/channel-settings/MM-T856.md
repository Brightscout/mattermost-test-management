## MM-T856: Add existing users to public channel from drop-down > Add Members

---

**Step 1**

Add existing users to public channel from drop-down > Add Members (Se tests all but real-time multi-user verification)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In another window/browser, log in as another user, who you want to add to the public channel \[user2]

2. As user1 in your main browser or device, view a public channel other than Town Square or Off-Topic (can create a new channel if needed)

3. Click the "v" to the right of the channel name at the top of the center panel (mobile apps tap the channel name)

4. Click or tap "Add Members" and search for 'user2'

5. Select the member \[user2] you want to add to the channel and observe that the user is added to the modal text box or on mobile has check mark next to the name

   1. Verify status icon displays on the user's profile picture on the search results list

6. Select additional members \[user3, user4] you wish to add to the channel

7. Click or tap `Add`

_Important notes about this step:_

Join/leave messages are expected to show in a fixed order (not chronological); this is so multiple joins or multiple leaves can be combined regardless of sequence

**Expected**

- at step 5. Selected user is removed from the list as soon as it is selected to be added

- At step 7. System message posts in channel for each user added: "\[user2, user3, user4] added to the channel by \[user1]" (or "added... by you"), visible for both user1 and user2

- This step N/A for mobile view / RN: 

  - On user1 clicking "members" icon at top of channel, added user2 and user3 appear in list

---

**Step 2**

After adding user to channel, other user should no longer see that user available to add to that same channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Ensure Town Square has 3 members (user1, user2, user3)
2. Log in as user2 
3. As user2 open channel drop-down for Town Square ➜ Add Members
4. Ensure user1 and user3 are not listed as available to add to channel

(Won't Fix) [Manage members list does not update if a user is added to a channel — MM-10546](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10546) Newly added user doesn't appear immediately for other user who was already viewing Add Members list

**Expected**

- User2 does not see user3 listed as available to add to the channel.
- Refresh is not necessary to view the accurately updated list
