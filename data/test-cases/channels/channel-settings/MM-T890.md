## MM-T890: Unread channels sort at top

---

**Step 1**

1. View LHS / open channel drawer (with at least one unread channel)
2. Verify unread channel(s) display at top of channel list, Mentions listed first then in alphabetical order, with title "Unreads"
3. Click / tap an unread channel to view it
4. View LHS / channel drawer again

_Important notes about this step:_

**RN Apps**: This feature is always enabled\
**Non-RN apps**: Use a server where this is turned on, like community-release.mattermost.com:\
**Note**: Ensure you're on a server with the Unreads feature turned on in config.json (such as community-release.mattermost.com) and enabled for your user in Settings âžœ Sidebar\
**QA note**: Fully covered for webapp in Se, also follow comments to verify manually on RN devices by following along with Se test

**Expected**

- Channel you just read is no longer listed in Unreads
