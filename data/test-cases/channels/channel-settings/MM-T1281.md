## MM-T1281: Channel sidebar: channel scrolls into view in LHS when using Find Channel modal (or from permalink) (webapp)

**Precondition**

Blocked until <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22371> and <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19380> are resolved.

---

**Step 1**

1. With enough channels in the LHS to scroll:
2. Press CTRL/CMD+K and select a channel that is out of view in the LHS then hit Enter

**Expected**

The LHS should scroll the channel you've switched to into view

---

**Step 2**

1. Get the permalink on any post in a test channel
2. Switch channels so the channel you got the permalink from is out of view in the LHS
3. Paste the permalink into the channel you've switched to, hit Enter to make the post
4.  Click on the permalink you've just posted
