[RN: It is possible to remove members from an archived channel — MM-13394](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13394)

**Expected**

**Desktop App and browser**:

- There is no option to "view" or "manage" members, only to view the member list per [MM-13394](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13394)

**Mobile**:

- Manage Members has been replaced with View Members. When opened there is no option to remove the users
