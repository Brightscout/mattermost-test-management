Unarchived channels can be searched the same as before they where archived\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post some text in the channel such as "Pineapple"
2. Archive the channel
3. Unarchive the channel
4. Ensure that Allow user to search archived channels is disabled
5. Search for the post from step 1
