## MM-T1687: Archiving a channel doesn't crash the web page for users that weren't a member of the channel

**Precondition**

# Important

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

---

**Step 1**

Archiving a channel doesn't crash the web page for users that weren't a member of the channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in on the web app as USER 1
2. Log in on a different browser or incognito as USER 2
3. Have USER 1 create or join a private channel
4. Have USER 2 join the channel as well
5. Have USER 1 archive that channel
6. Observe USER 2's session
