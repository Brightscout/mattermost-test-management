## MM-T1710: When "Allow users to view archived channels" is set to False, archived channels are not listed on the "in:" autocomplete

**Precondition**

# Important

Ensure that \`Allow users to view archived channels\` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

---

**Step 1**

When "Allow users to view archived channels" is set to False, archived channels are not listed on the "in:" autocomplete\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
First, as system admin, ensure that System Console > Users and Teams > Allow users to view archived channels is set to \`false\`.

1. Archive a channel and make a mental note of the channel name
2. Place the focus in the search box
3. Type "in:" and note the list of channels that appear

**Expected**

- Archived channels are not listed in auto-complete as the feature is disabled
