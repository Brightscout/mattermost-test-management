**Precondition**

# Important

Ensure that \`Allow users to view archived channels\` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

**Step 1**

An archived channel can't be searched when "Allow users to view archived channels" is set to False in "Site Configuration > Users and Teams" in the System Console\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––\
First, as system admin, ensure that System Console > Users and Teams > Allow users to view archived channels is set to \`false\`.

1. Open a channel other than Town Square
2. Create or locate a channel you're a member of
3. Post distinctive text in the channel such as "I like pineapples"
4. Select Archive Channel from the header menu
5. Archive dialogue message reads "This will archive the channel from the team and make its contents inaccessible for all users" (Mobile dialogue makes no mention of the data will be accessible)
6. Select Archive
7. Channel closes and user is brought to the channel you were viewing in step 1
8. Search for post created in step 2

**Expected**

- Post created in step 2 is not returned in search results
