## MM-T1709: Archive a channel while search results are displayed in RHS

**Precondition**

# Important

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

**Step 1**

Archive a channel while search results are displayed in RHS\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
First, as system admin, ensure that System Console > Users and Teams > Allow users to view archived channels is set to `false`.\
\\

1. Post a unique string of text in a channel
2. Search for the string of text from step 1
3. Observe the post is displayed in RHS results
4. While the RHS is still open with the results, archive the channel the post was made in
