5. Perform a search for the text from the step #2
   \
   Verify that the post is shown in the search results
6. Switch back to the archived channel through the permalink and leave the channel
7. Perform a search for the text form the step #2 again
   \
   a. Verify that the post is no longer shown in the search results
