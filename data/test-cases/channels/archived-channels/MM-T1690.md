## MM-T1690: RN apps: Unread channel is removed from drawer when archived by another user

**Precondition**

_**Important:**_

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

---

**Step 1**

Unread channel is removed from drawer when archived by another user\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. From RN login to a server with a test user and ensure that all channels in the drawer are read
2. From a different session, login as a different user
3. Make a post that does not include a mention in one of the channels that the test user is a member of
4. From the other session archive the channel

**Expected**

- The test users sees the unread channel appear in the UNREADS section of the drawer after step 3
- After other user archives the channel, unread channel is removed from drawer and UNREADS section is removed as well since there are no more unread channels for the test user
