**Precondition**

# Important

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

**Step 1**

Favorited archived channel is removed from channel drawer in RN apps\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a private channel where you are the only member
2. Favorite the private channel
3. Archive the channel
4. Close the archived view of the channel
5. View the team's channel list on RN iOS (can also check Android, but original issue was iOS-specific)

**Expected**

- The channel is no longer in the channels list drawer
- Favorites section is removed
