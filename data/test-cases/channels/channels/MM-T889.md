## MM-T889: RN apps: Channel sidebar - More unreads

---

**Step 1**

**With enough channels in the channel drawer to make it scrollable**:

1. Have another user post messages in channel(s) until you can scroll unread channels off the top of the screen
2. Scroll LHS down and observe "â‡¡ More unreads"\

3. Tap the indicator and observe it scrolls the channel list up
4. updated below:
5. Tap on the top unread channel, open the LHS and repeat steps 4 - 6 until all unread channels are now read and do it one more time selecting the first read channel in the list.

**Expected**

- Tapping the indicator scrolls the channel list so unread channels are at the top
- It should always take you to the channel
