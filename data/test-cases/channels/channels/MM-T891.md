### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>In a channel with a long message history (such as Developers on community-release.mattermost.com):<ol><li>Swipe repeatedly to scroll message list and load more messages (do this for quite a while; at least 10 or so batches of messages loaded)</li><li>After loading more messages many times in a row, tap hamburger icon and switch channels a couple times</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>A set of more messages should load automatically each time the top of the list is reached</li><li>Hamburger icon should still be responsive, and channel switching should still be fast after loading all those messages</li></ul></article>
