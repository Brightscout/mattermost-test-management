## MM-T3827: Find Channels modal should focus first result

---

**Step 1**

Find Channels modal should focus first result\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Open Find Channels modal (ctrl/cmd+k)
2. Type a partial search term, something you know will return few results
   \
   i) Verify first item is focused
3. Use backspace to delete the last character added
   \
   i) Verify first item is focused after backspacing
4. Hover over one of the results (or use arrow keys to move from the top result); use backspace again
   \
   i) Verify first item is in focus after backspace

**Expected**

At step 2. > First item in the results list should be in focus\
At step 3. > First item in the results list should remain in focus when backspacing\
At step 4. > Mouse hover and keyboard arrows selection of the result does not keep the focus after backspace is used and will jump focus back to top result
