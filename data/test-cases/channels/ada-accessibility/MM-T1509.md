## MM-T1509: Tabbing to 'Cancel' button in a warning message does not behave as 'Confirm'

**Step 1**

Tabbing to "Cancel" button in a warning message does not behave as "Confirm"\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In a test channel containing more than 5 test users
2. Type "@all" and hit Enter
3. When the warning message appears, TAB to focus on the "Cancel" button
4. Hit Enter

**Expected**

- After step 3 the warning modal closes, the post should not be sent and "@all" should be left in the message input box
