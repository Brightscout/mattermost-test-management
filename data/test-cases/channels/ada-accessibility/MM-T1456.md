**Step 1**

Email input box in "Send Email Invite" reads the placeholder for the email address correctly\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Main menu > send email invite, click on the email text input field

_Related ticket(s):_

(**Story**) [ADA: Send Email Invite dialog email field has incorrect label — MM-16059](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16059)

**Test Data**

**Known issues to be fixed in future tickets**:

- Using the up/down keys to navigate in the Main Menu is not implemented yet. Can use TAB key for now
- Once the reader has read out the email placeholder text, it continues to read a posted message in the channel behind the modal. This will be fixed with another ticket.

**Expected**

- Reader reads out "email\@domain.com edit type in text"
