- This is a huge area to test - here's the short list:

  - Message List Main Region (center panel) and Message Details (RHS)
  - Reply Input Region (RHS)
  - MESSAGE DETAILS (top of reply area in RHS)
  - Message Input Complimentary Region (center)
  - Team Menu Region (top of LHS)
  - Channel Sidebar Region (LHS)
  - Channel Header Region (top of Center)
  - Region at the top of a newly created channel
  - Main Menu - Account Settings
  - Main Menu - All options - the reader reads out the option name (e.g. Account Settings ➜ Invite People ➜ etc.) but does NOT read "Press Space Bar to activate" although pressing Space Bar to activate DOES work for SOME options (see below in the notes)

**Expected**
