**Step 1**

Pinned posts, search, @mention button, saved posts are read out correctly\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Press F6 (desktop app) or CTRL+F6 (browser) until you are positioned in the "Channel Header Region" (reader will read this out and it will be highlighted)
2. Hit the tab to go through the options along the top
3. Open the RHS and then repeat the above making sure all the options along the top are still read out correctly
