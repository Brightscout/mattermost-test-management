**Step 1**

All menus that open a modal should be announced by the screen reader\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
This involves testing all menus that open modals:

1. Check all menu options in the Main Menu
2. On a public or private channel that you created (so you have access to all menu options) check all options in the channel dropdown
3. In a direct message, check "Edit Header" option in the channel dropdown
4. In a group message, check all options in the channel dropdown

**Expected**

- Each modal that is opened should be announced by the screen reader
- Each sub-section within each modal (e.g. notification preferences modal sub-sections) should be announced as you navigate through the modal in the screen-reader
