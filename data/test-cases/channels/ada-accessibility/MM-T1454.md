## MM-T1454: All menus that open a modal should be announced by the screen reader

**Precondition**

JAWS Screen Reader required: <https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS>\
Eric has a license key to upgrade the free version - ping him if required\
Switch off the "PC virtual cursor" within JAWS by pressing INSERT+Z\
Navigation to various focus areas: CTRL+F6 in browsers; F6 in desktop app\
The feature is not available on the RN apps.

---

**Step 1**

All menus that open a modal should be announced by the screen reader\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
This involves testing all menus that open modals:

1. Check all menu options in the Main Menu
2. On a public or private channel that you created (so you have access to all menu options) check all options in the channel dropdown
3. In a direct message, check "Edit Header" option in the channel dropdown
4. In a group message, check all options in the channel dropdown

**Expected**

- Each modal that is opened should be announced by the screen reader
- Each sub-section within each modal (e.g. notification preferences modal sub-sections) should be announced as you navigate through the modal in the screen-reader
