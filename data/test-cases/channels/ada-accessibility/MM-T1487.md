**Step 1**

Manage Channel Members\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click on Manage Members from a Channel Menu
2. Press TAB to navigate between different Remove Member buttons

**Expected**

- When Manage Members dialog is opened, ensure the reader reads the title as "Dialong Manage Members" and the name of the channel
- Search box should have focus and should be read after the dialog name
- Tab through to different Remove Channel Member buttons should read the "\[Username] remove member button"
- If Remove Channel button is not present, it should have Channel Member buttons instead and should read "\[Username] channel member button"
- When searched for users without any results, it should state "0 of X members total"
- When searched for users with results, it should state "N of X members total"
- When searched for users with results and TAB is pressed, it should read the username of the first user in the list and the name of their current role.
- Pressing TAB keys should focus between the 'Remove Member' buttons of different users. The focus should not go automatically back to the search input
