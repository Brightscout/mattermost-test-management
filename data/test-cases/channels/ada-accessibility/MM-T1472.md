–––––––––––––––––––––––––

- Use CTRL+F6 to navigate to the channel sidebar region and Up/Down arrows to focus a sidebar section (ie Direct Messages):

**Expected**

- "Create new direct message"

- Channel names

  - DM: eg "Andrew Brown" - if unreads: "Andrew Brown two messages"
  - GM: eg "Elias Nahum Harrison Healey" - if mentions: "Elias Nahum Harrison Healey two mentions" - if unreads only: "Elias Nahum Harrison Healey unread link"
  - "More direct messages button, to activate press space bar"
