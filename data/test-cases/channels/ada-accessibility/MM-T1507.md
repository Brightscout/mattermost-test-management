## MM-T1507: Profile modal focuses properly when the last item of a section is closed

---

**Step 1**

Profile modal focuses properly when the last item of a section is closed\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In Mattermost, tab to the User avatar on global header and hit ENTER. Tab to Profile item on the menu and hit ENTER. The Profile modal should be displayed.
2. Tab until the Edit button for Email is highlighted, and hit ENTER.
3. Tab until the Cancel button is highlighted and hit ENTER.

**Expected**

- The section closes and the Edit button for the section you've just closed (Email) should be focused.
- The screen reader should read a) the end result of closing the section and b) the label of the focused button (i.e. Email edit button).
