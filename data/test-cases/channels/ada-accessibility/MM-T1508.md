## MM-T1508: Images across the app show ALT text or an aria label

---

**Step 1**

Images across the app show ALT text or an aria label\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log into the app
2. On the image you want to check, right click and select "inspect"
3. Look for text following "alt"\
   (e.g. in the screenshot to the right the text is "lindy.isherwood profile image")\
   (Alternatively, for example, on images posted in the center channel, you might only see an aria label (second screenshot to the right)

- Images to check:

  - User's profile image
  - top of LHS
  - on a post
  - in their profile pop-over (when clicking on their profile image on a post)
  - in Account Settings > General > Profile Picture
  - in Manage/View Members (from channel drop-down menu)
  - in Add Members (from channel drop-down menu)
  - in Main Menu > Invite People > Invite People field (the avatar next to the name once you've typed it into the field)
  - in "Members" button (for channel members)
  - Images for default themes in Account Settings > Display >Theme
  - Any images posted in the center channel

**Expected**
