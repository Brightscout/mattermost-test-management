## MM-T1463: Menu dropdowns should select first option after tab

---

**Step 1**

Menu dropdowns should select first option after tab\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Focus the Main menu, channel menu, or post \[...] menu, press ENTER or space to open the menu
2. Using a screen reader press tab attempting to move through the menu options

**Expected**

- After opening the menu, the first item should be selected with the mouse hover effect (not the screen reader highlight), ie Account Settings in the main menu.\
  **Note**: Behavior was changed - see <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbm_MCFfnRwQ64t5MRor9DhTV7QZRFfeK576EAZ7PV4/edit#gid=1685711705&range=A47>
- Continuing to press TAB should move through the options and read them out, wrapping back up/down to the first/last option when applicable.
