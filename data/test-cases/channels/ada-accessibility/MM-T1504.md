## MM-T1504: POST textbox reads characters when reviewing with arrow keys and text can be reviewed using INS+5 and INS+8 (numbers are on the number keypad with NumLock OFF)

**Step 1**

POST textbox reads characters when reviewing with arrow keys and text can be reviewed using INS+5 and INS+8 (numbers are on the number keypad with NumLock OFF)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Type some characters in the message input box (be sure to include a `\~` and an `@`)
2. Use the arrow keys to move back and forth through the text

**Expected**

- Characters are read when arrowing through them and text can be reviewed with INSERT+5, INSERT+8
- This should apply to the RHS and main message input fields
