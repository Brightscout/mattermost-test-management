**Step 1**

Message autocomplete reads out matching entries\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Use "@" then type characters then use the down arrow key
2. Use "\~" then type characters then use the down arrow key

**Expected**

- Down/up arrow moves through the results and reads the usernames as they get highlighted by the grey selection color. ie "eric\_8" "eric\_test2" etc.
- Down arrow moves down the results and reads the channel names and purposes as they get highlighted by the grey selection color. ie "apiv4. Discussion related to moving toward APIv4." "Apps Team" etc.
