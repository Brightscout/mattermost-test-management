## MM-T1446: RN apps: Share extension - Should alert the sharer if they're not member of any team

---

**Step 1**

1. Create a user which is not member of any team (or log in as any user and leave all teams).
2. Do not log out of Mattermost, but put it in the background.
3. Open another app where you can share a file from, such as photo gallery, and try to share a file via Mattermost share extension.

**Expected**

- Should alert you with “_You must belong to a team before you can share files._”
