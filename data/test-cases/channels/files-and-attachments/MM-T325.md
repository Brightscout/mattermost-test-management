## MM-T325: RN apps: Opening attachments different ways in the UI (reply thread view)

---

**Step 1**

RN Apps: Opening attachments different ways in the UI (reply thread view)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create or locate a post with various file types attached
2. Tap the post to open in reply thread view
3. From reply thread, tap on attachment icon
4. From reply thread, tap on attachment name

_Important notes about this step:_

You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

- For supported document types (e.g. pdf), tapping on attachment icon bypasses the file preview gallery while tapping on attachment name opens the file preview gallery
- The rest of the cases the preview gallery is opened
