_Important notes about this step:_

You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

- You should see:

  - progress indicator
  - processing state (may be very brief, okay if you don't catch it)
  - then shows the image or file thumbnail with an `x` to remove the uploaded file from the message draft
