**Step 1**

Progress indicator for file upload\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click the paper clip icon on the message box (mobile apps: Tap any of the icons to attach a file to the post) and select a LARGE file to attach so you can view progress indicator

**Expected**

- You should see:

  - progress indicator 
  - processing state (may be very brief, okay if you don't catch it)
  - then shows the image or file thumbnail with an \`x\` to remove the uploaded file from the message draft
