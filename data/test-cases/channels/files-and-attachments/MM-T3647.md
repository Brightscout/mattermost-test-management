\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Attach a PDF file and post

2. Click on the PDF to open Preview

3. Click on + few times to zoom in

   1. Verify user can scroll up/down and right/left
   2. Verify user can drag both vertical and horizontal scroll bars

4. Click on reset

5. Click on - few times to zoom out

6. Post a file that is not a PDF and verify zoom options are not available when previewing

- You should be able to zoom in, out and reset zoom on PDF file preview.
- Scroll bars should be visible in both, light and dark themes when zoomed in enough to trigger the scroll bars and can be dragged
- Zoom options are not available when previewing files that do not support zooming.
