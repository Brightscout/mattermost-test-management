## MM-T345: Public links for common file types should open in a new browser tab

---

**Step 1**

Public links for common file types should open in a new browser tab\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Account Settings ➜ Display ➜ Image Previews ➜ Expanded
2. Make a post with an attachment of any of the following types:
3. jpeg, png, bmp, .tiff, gif, avi, mpeg, mp4, mpeg, or wav
4. Click on the image preview
5. Click on "Get public link"
6. Click on "Copy link", then on "Close"
7. Paste the link into the message input box and hit "Enter" to make the post
8. Click on the link

_Important notes about this step:_

- If you don't see "Get public link," ensure Public Links are enabled in System Console ➜ Site Configuration ➜ Public Links
- You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

- A new browser tab should open and the image (video or sound file) you posted in channel in step 2 should be displayed
