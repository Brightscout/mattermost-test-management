## MM-T390: Team icon appears immediately on other user on mobile app and on browser, also: tall or wide images zoom to center and crop, like profile pictures do

---

**Step 1**

**With other user still viewing team in other browser**:

1. Ensure other user is on more than one team and can see team sidebar (add them to another team if necessary)
2. As team admin, go to Main Menu > Team Settings, and click `Edit` in Team Icon section
3. Select a JPG or PNG that is taller than it is wide, or wider than it is tall, observe that the upload preview shows it zoomed into the center of the image (not stretched or squashed to fit)
4. Click `Save`

**Expected**

- Team icon appears in team sidebar immediately for both users
- Team icon is square, zoomed in on the center of the image (not stretched or squashed to fit)
