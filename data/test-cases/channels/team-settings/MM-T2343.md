## MM-T2343: Non-Authenticated user is directed to correct team when clicking Join Team link

---

**Step 1**

Non-Authenticated user is directed to correct team when clicking Join Team link\
————————————————————————————\
1\. As a test user, join a team on the server that would be sorted high in the team list (A-team)\
2\. As a second user who is a member of another team that would be sorted lower in the team list (Z-team), copy team invite link\
3\. As the test user logout of the server\
4\. As the test user, open the team invite link and sign in

**Expected**

User is directed to the MM server with the correct team opening after the test user authenticates
