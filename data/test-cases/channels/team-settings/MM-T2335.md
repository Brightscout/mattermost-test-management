With a &quot;Member&quot; (non-admin) account, join at least two teams<br />2. As a Team Admin on one of the teams that Member joined, make it not-join-able: Team Settings &gt; General &gt; Allow anyone to join this team &gt; Edit &gt; No<br />3. On that now-private team, go to Main Menu &gt; Manage Members<br />3. Copy the URL for that team (not an invite; just the URL)<br />4. Click &quot;Remove user from team&quot; next to the Member from step one<br />5. Log out<br />6. Log in to the server with the removed member's credentials<br />7. Attempt to open the URL for the team you were just removed from (copied in step 3)</article>

**Expected**

> <article>You should not be able to open the team, and you should be redirected to the first team that appears on team sidebar.<br /><br />(If you only belong to one team, then team sidebar doesn't appear)</article>
