## MM-T388: Invite new user to closed team with "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team" set to "mattermost.com" AND include a non-mattermost.com email address in the invites

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure that Main Menu > Team Settings > Allow any user with an account on this server... is set to \`No\`
2. Ensure "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team" is set to "mattermost.com"
3. Open Main Menu and click \`Invite People\`
4. Enter an email address you can access (can use your Mm email using a plus sign, like so: \`linda+anything\@mattermost.com\`)
5. Enter another non-mattermost email address (this can be fictitious as it is just needed to check the error message)
6. Click \`Invite Members\`

**Expected**

- An error message is displayed:

  - "The following email addresses do not belong to an accepted domain: xxxxx\@gmail.com. Please contact your System Administrator for details."

**Note**: After verifying the above, you can cancel out of the screen
