## MM-T384: Team Admin can use Next button to page through list in Manage Members

---

**Step 1**

Team Admin can use Next button to page through list in Manage Members\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Locate a team where you are team admin, that has more than 50 users
   \
   **OR**\
   Create a new team, then post the command `/test users 60` so that you are team admin on a team with more than 50 users
2. Click hamburger main menu and select Manage Members to open Manage Members dialog
3. Click the "Next" button to view the next page of users
4. Click "Next" a few more times to page through the list
5. Click "Previous" at least once to page backward in list

[Regression: "Next" button in Main Menu > Manage Members is not visible to see the last few members of the team — MM-26022](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26022)

**Expected**

- Member count below the search bar reads "XX - YY members of YY total". e.g. "51-75 members of 75 total"
- Next button appears at the bottom until the last page is reached even if that means only 1 member past the 50 shown on a page
- Once the list is exhausted there shouldn't be a 'Next' button at the bottom

---

**Step 2**

1. On a team with more than 50 users log in as a System Admin
2. Go to System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Users
3. Change the User status to filter out members
4. Click the "Next" button to view the next page of users
5. Click "Next" a few more times to page through the list
6. Click "Previous" at least once to page backward in list
