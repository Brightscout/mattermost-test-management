## MM-T392: User viewing team while they are removed from it sees display change

---

**Step 1**

**Can continue using new user created in MM-T389**

1. View a team you and another user are both on
2. In a separate browser, user2 views any channel on the team
3. User1 clicks hamburger main menu and selects Manage Members
4. User1 finds user2 in the list and clicks the drop-down next to the name and selects "Remove from team" (on dark theme, verify drop-down is legible)

**Expected**

- If user2 was only on that one team, they see team selection / creation page
- If user2 had been on two teams, they are redirected to the last channel they were viewing on the other team they're on, and the team sidebar disappears
- If user2 had been on more than two teams, they are redirected to the last channel they were viewing of the new top team in the team sidebar, and the team they were removed from no longer appears in team sidebar
