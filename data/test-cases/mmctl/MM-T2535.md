## MM-T2535: --strict flag

**Objective**

# Include in monthly smoke-test

---

**Step 1**

\--strict flag\
————————————————————————————

1. In a command line window set to the directory where 'mmctl' is installed in
2. Connect to a server that is not running the same version as mmctl is (e.g. prev.test with mmctl v5.22)

**Expected**

- You will get feedback saying "credentials for prev.test stored"

---

**Step 2**

1. e.g. "mmctl auth login https\://prev.test.mattermost.com --name prev.test --username john.doe --password mysupersecret"\
   \
   **Note**: Enter valid username and password for a system admin user

**Expected**

- You will see a warning as follows: "WARNING: server version x.xx.x.release-5.xx.xx.9bb0ce5.af1af0d71b40157b8025d9538a146623.true doesn't match mmctl version 5.22.0"

---

**Step 3**

1. Run "mmctl team list" (or any command that requires communication with the server)
2. Run "mmctl team list --strict"

**Expected**

- **After 1**: 

  - You will get feedback saying "ERROR: server version 5.xx.x.release-5.xx.xx.9bb0ce5.af1af0d71b40157b8025d9538a146623.true doesn't match with mmctl version 5.22.0. Strict flag is set, so the command will not be run"
