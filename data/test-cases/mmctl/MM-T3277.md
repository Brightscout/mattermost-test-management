**Step 1**

1\. Go to any team and via Team Menu > Team Settings, ascertain whether the team is private or public\
\
2\. Depending on the setting above, run the following:\
`mmctl team modify \[teamname] --private`\
\
3\. Then run:\
`mmctl team modify \[teamname] --public`

**Expected**

After 2 and 3 you'll get feedback saying "Modified team 'teamname'"\
