## MM-T2854: Do this first ➜ Getting set up

---

**Step 1**

**Getting set up**:

- Go to mmctl\` releases: <https://github.com/mattermost/mmctl/releases> and select the release that matches the version that is being shipped with this release
-  Download the Windows .zip file then unzip it
-  In a command window, go to the directory you unzipped \`mmctl\` to and run mmctl.exe
-  You are now set up to begin on the tests below

**If for some reason you want to test the latest, unreleased version, you can get the code from GitHub by following these steps**:

- Install Golang <https://golang.org/>
- Find the directory on your PC that you installed Golang in
- Open a \`command line\` window and change to the Golang directory
-  To install mmctl, type "go get -u github.com/mattermost/mmctl"
-  Once the code has been fetched, change to the \`bin\` directory within your Golang directory and run 'mmctl.exe'
