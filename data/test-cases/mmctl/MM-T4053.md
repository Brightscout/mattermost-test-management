## MM-T4053: Config Patch (No permissions)

---

**Step 1**

From an ordinary user:\
\- create a .json file containing the changes you want to make to the server's config\
\- mmctl config patch \[newconfig.json]

**Expected**

An error is returned as you don't have the correct permissions (e.g. system admin)
