### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Run a command to add a user to a channel using "mmctl channel add"<br>2. Run a command to remove a user from a channel using "mmctl channel remove"<br>3. Run "mmctl channel users --help"<br>4. Run a command to add a user to a channel using "mmctl channel users add"<br>5. Run a command to remove a user from a channel using "mmctl channel users remove"<br>6. Run "mmctl channel --help"</article>

**Expected**

> <article>After 1 and 2, the commands should work but mmctl should print a message indicating that they are deprecated<br>After 3, a help screen showing information about the channel users sub-commands should be shown<br>After 4 and 5, both commands should work exactly like the ones in 1 and 2, but without the deprecation message<br>After 6, in the help, the "add" and "remove" commands should not be shown as they are marked as deprecated, but a "users" sub-command should appear</article>
