Upgrade from Mattermost Team Edition to Mattermost Enterprise Edition (Starter tier). The reason is that someone who runs the open-source version cannot upload a license or start a trial. They must first upgrade to the commercial Enterprise Edition. We allow them to do that with a single button.<br />2. License field which tells where the MIT license and the NOTICE.txt files are that ships with the binary.<br />3. Written commercial license for those who do step 1 and upgrade to the commercial Enterprise Edition.<br />4. Clear note that this is a Team Edition binary.<br /><br />ENTERPRISE EDITION (STARTER PLAN)<br /><br />1. Ability to start a trial.<br />2. License field which tells where the ENTERPRISE-EDITION license and the NOTICE.txt files are that ships with the binary.<br />3. Location to upload a license key.<br />4. Clear note that this is an Enterprise Edition binary for Starter plan.<br /><br />ENTERPRISE EDITION (ENTERPRISE TRIAL)<br />1. Ability to make a purchase self-serve, or contact sales. Both options are present during and after the trial.<br />2. License field which tells where the ENTERPRISE-EDITION license and the NOTICE.txt files are that ships with the binary.<br />3. Details about the trial license, including the expiry date.<br />4. Ability to remove the Enterprise license and downgrade server.<br />5.
