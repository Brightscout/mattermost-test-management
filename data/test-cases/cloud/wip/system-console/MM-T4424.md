## MM-T4424: System Console license page

---

**Step 1**

1. Download and install Mattermost Team edition locally
2. Verify that there isn't any way to upload a license
3. Verify ability to start trial
4. Once trial starts verify Enterprise features are present
5. Cancel trial and verify there's a spot to upload a license
6. Remove license and verify features are no longer present
7. Verify links to contact sales work when no license is present

_Important notes about this step:_

**Notes from the FIGMA (to be removed later)**\
1\. Upgrade from Mattermost Team Edition to Mattermost Enterprise Edition (Starter tier). The reason is that someone who runs the open-source version cannot upload a license or start a trial. They must first upgrade to the commercial Enterprise Edition. We allow them to do that with a single button.\
2\. License field which tells where the MIT license and the NOTICE.txt files are that ships with the binary.\
3\. Written commercial license for those who do step 1 and upgrade to the commercial Enterprise Edition.\
4\. Clear note that this is a Team Edition binary.\
\
ENTERPRISE EDITION (STARTER PLAN)\
\
1\. Ability to start a trial.\
2\. License field which tells where the ENTERPRISE-EDITION license and the NOTICE.txt files are that ships with the binary.\
3\. Location to upload a license key.\
4\. Clear note that this is an Enterprise Edition binary for Starter plan.\
\
ENTERPRISE EDITION (ENTERPRISE TRIAL)\
1\. Ability to make a purchase self-serve, or contact sales. Both options are present during and after the trial.\
2\. License field which tells where the ENTERPRISE-EDITION license and the NOTICE.txt files are that ships with the binary.\
3\. Details about the trial license, including the expiry date.\
4\. Ability to remove the Enterprise license and downgrade server.\
5\. Ability to view Enterprise terms of use and privacy policy\
6\. Clear note that this is an Enterprise Edition binary for Enterprise plan.\
\
ENTERPRISE EDITION (ENTERPRISE PLAN)\
\
Same as Enterprise trial, except for the first use case, there will be an option to either renew self-serve, or contact sales once there is less than 60 days remaining in their license period.\
\
ENTERPRISE EDITION (PROFESSIONAL PLAN)\
\
Same as Enterprise, except\
1\. any references to Enterprise plan are replaced with references to Professional plan.\
2\. provide a CTA to contact sales to upgrade to Enterprise\
\
ENTERPRISE EDITION (STARTER GOV)\
\
Same as Enterprise, except\
1\. any references to Enterprise plan are replaced with references to Starter GOV plan.\
2\. provide a CTA to contact sales to upgrade to Professional or Enterprise GOV plans.
