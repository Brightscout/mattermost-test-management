| Update notes             | Steve Mudie — Friday, September 18, 2020 5:11 PM<br>• Last successful execution was on 10/Sep/20<br>• Toggled test to "Update" status until Cypress code can be reviewed<br>–––––––––––––––––––––––––<br>Steve Mudie — Monday, September 21, 2020 9:46 AM<br>• Touched base with Devin and it passed the test on his local build<br>• I added it back to the manual pool for coverage until we can fix the odd fails and broken connection to Cypress since the last report was on the 14th<br>• Devin had this to say as well in case it has any bearing on what's going on here: "<em>One thought comes to mind: there was an issue with a version of cypress we were using a few weeks back, I'm not sure if it was reverted or if it was updated, so that could potentially have caused the failures.</em>" |
