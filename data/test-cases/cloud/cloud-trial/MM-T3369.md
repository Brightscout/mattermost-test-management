## MM-T3369: Cloud Trial — Getting Started

---

**Step 1**

1. If a user has the ‘Getting Started’ item visible in the LHS and they click the 'x' icon in it, a modal shows letting the user know they can get back to “Getting Started” through the Main Menu

**Expected**

- “Getting Started” is removed from the LHS if they confirm to remove it in the modal
- Main Menu should retain “Getting Started”
