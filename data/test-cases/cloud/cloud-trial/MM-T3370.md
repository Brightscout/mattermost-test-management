## MM-T3370: Cloud Trial — Skip Getting Started

---

**Step 1**

If a user has the 'Getting Started' section active and clicks “Skip Getting Started”, this transitions to become “Tips & Next Steps” and there is now no way back to the Getting Started Steps since the user has explicitly chosen to skip it.

[Cloud: Getting Started is complete but it doesn't want to leave (AKA: Tips & Next Steps is having an identity crisis) — MM-34703](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34703)

**Expected**

- LHS Menu Item changes to “Tips & Next Steps”
- Main Menu changes from “Getting Started” to “Tips & Next Steps”
