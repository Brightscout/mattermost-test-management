## MM-T5063: Files Limit: Archived file in post

---

**Step 1**

1. Have a dev set the file limit for Starter plans down to 1 GB âžœ 8,589,934,592 via Stripe
2. Create a Workspace or use one already on Starter
3. Upload enough files to push it past the 1 GB limit\
   **Note:** File (99mb.txt) attached to this test case can be used for this purpose
4. Add whatever bogus metadata to the subscription in Stripe
5. Wait a few minutes then refresh the page
6. Add a few more files

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- Observe that files within the 1GB window are accessible, and that the UI is unchanged from production
- Observe that files not within the 1GB window are not accessible, show a tooltip when hovered explaining the reason they are inaccessible, and show the appropriate display when in compact mode
