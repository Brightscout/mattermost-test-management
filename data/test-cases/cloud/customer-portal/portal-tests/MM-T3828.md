## MM-T3828: Self-serve renewals (test environment)

**Objective**

These steps outline the process for customers to renew license that are about to expire for self-hosted installations

---

**Step 1**

Self-serve renewals\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create an account on <https://portal.test.cloud.mattermost.com/>
2. Purchase an on-prem E10 license
3. Apply the license on [this server](https://mattermost-server-pr-16778.test.mattermost.cloud/admin_console/about/license)
4. Generate a renewal link ([instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yOh7hFZRRliKClz7bVo0XJG9gm7C7NRcIwkLt2mAB2k/edit?usp=sharing))
5. Use the link then fill in the form and complete the purchase to renew your license
6. Upload the new license to the server you used in step 3 above

_Important notes about this step:_

- The instructions linked to in step 4 above contain most of what you see here but you really only need to follow the steps on how to generate the link then return here to complete the tests
- These steps are subject to change as development is currently in progress but will work as written as of Wednesday, January 27, 2021

**Expected**

- After 3 the applied license should reflect a one-year period starting from the day you purchased the license you used

- After 4:

  - you should have a link you can use that looks something like the example below\
    https\://portal.dev.cloud.mattermost.com/subscribe/renew?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJsaWNlbnNlX2lkIjoiMzRueXRtNzUxamZncHl1cmJ1OGQ3dzZlZGMiLCJhY3RpdmVfdXNlcnMiOjE3LCJleHAiOjE2MTIzNzM1MTh9.9\_-9Teu-K8AWrMZE1\_yGzZD8JPhLsvANVaL9koewadc

  - The link opens a renewal form with the following fields pre-filled:

    - Organization name
    - First & Last Name
    - Email address
    - Renewal Summary (reflects a one year period that starts on the day your current license expires)
    - Your current plan (E10) selected
    - Current licensed users (seats) listed below Total Active users (which is shown in the large box where you can change it

  - You're not able to complete the purchase without filling in the **Additional Contact** fields

  - You're not able to choose less than what the form shows for the current **Total Active Users**

  - You _are_ able to upgrade to an E20 license

- After 5:

  - you're able to download your license
  - there's a link on the success page that opens a modal with basic instructions
  - you can enter a password to create a portal account

- After 6 the dates reflect a one year license that starts at the end of the current license (one year from today)
