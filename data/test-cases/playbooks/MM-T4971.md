**Step 1**

1\. `View all...` for playbooks switches to the playbooks list (or `Get started` CTA if no existing playbooks) with templates underneath\
2\. `View all..` for runs switches to the run list, or the playbooks list if there are no existing runs.\
3\. In the + dropdown, `Browse playbooks` and `Browse runs` have the same behavior as 1 & 2.\
4\. Clicking an individual playbook opens the editor for the correct playbook.\
5\. Clicking an individual run opens the Run Details page for the correct run.
