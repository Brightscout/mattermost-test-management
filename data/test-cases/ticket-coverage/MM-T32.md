## MM-T32: MM-17441 — Cannot toggle between Safari windows on macOS using (command + `)

---

**Step 1**

1. Login to a Mattermost server on Safari
2. Create a new, separate — i.e., not tabbed — Safari window with any site
3.  With the webapp window in focus, hit ⌘\~ (Command+backtick/tilde)

**Expected**

- This should toggle back and forth between open, _separate_ Safari windows
