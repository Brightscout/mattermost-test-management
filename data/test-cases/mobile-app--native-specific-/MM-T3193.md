## MM-T3193: RN apps: Mute a channel - LHS appearance

---

**Step 1**

Mute a channel - LHS appearance\
————————————————————————————

1. Tap on the button to the right of "Mute Channel" in channel info

**Expected**

- A greyed-out "bell" with a line through it should be displayed to the right of the channel name at the top of the channel
- Channel is moved to the bottom of the section it is in in the channel drawer (if multiple muted channels in the same section, they are in alpha order among other muted channels at the bottom of the list)
