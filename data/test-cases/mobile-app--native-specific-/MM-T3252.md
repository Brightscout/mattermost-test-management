## MM-T3252: RN apps: Settings - Notifications - Mentions

---

**Step 1**

Settings - Notifications - Mentions\
————————————————————————————

1. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right of your screen

2.  Tap "Settings", then "Notifications"

3.  Tap "Mentions and Replies"

4. Ensure the following settings:

   - Case-sensitive first name = On (Note: This setting does not appear if the account does not have a first name set)
   - Non-case-sensitive username = Off
   - Channel-wide mentions = On
   - Keywords = \[enter some keyword here]

**Go back to channel view and lock device screen or put in background.\
Have another user make seven posts like so**:

1. including your lowercase first name (no mention)
2. including your username, with upper or lowercase (no mention)
3. at-yourusername in any non-DM channel (mention)
4. at-channel in a channel you're a member of (mention)
5. including your keyword (mention)
6. a DM with you (mention)
7. a GM including you, with none of your mention words in it (no mention)

**Expected**

- Settings are saved.
- Mentions fire or do not fire as described in the test steps.
- As described, there should be (4) mentions.
- Can tap notification to view the message.
- Non-mentions still appear as unreads.
