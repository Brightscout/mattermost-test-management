## MM-T3248: RN apps: Integration attachments - View Jira plugin messages

---

**Step 1**

Integration attachments - View Jira plugin messages\
————————————————————————————

1. View the Bugs channel on community-release.mattermost.com
2. Find a Jira message
3. View in center, then tap and view in reply thread
4. If a long enough integration attachment, tap `Show more` to expand post

**Expected**

- Verify the content (attachment) displays and you can see the bug description text in both center and reply thread
- If long attachment, can expand and collapse post to view more and less of its content
