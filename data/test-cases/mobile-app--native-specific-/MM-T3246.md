**Step 1**

> <article>File preview - Delete file cache<br>————————————————————————————<ol><li>Ensure you have downloaded a file such as a video or document in order to preview it</li><li>Verify that if you tap the file to preview, it does not download it again; it just shows the preview</li><li>Go to right-hand three-dot menu ➜ Settings ➜ Advanced Settings</li></ol></article>
