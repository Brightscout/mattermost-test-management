## MM-T3188: RN apps: More unreads indicator

---

**Step 1**

More unreads indicator\
————————————————————————————

1. On an account with enough channels to scroll part of the channel list off-screen, also make sure there are unreads in at least one channel
2. Tap the hamburger menu to open the channel drawer
3. Scroll the channel list so that unread channel(s) is/are off-screen

**Expected**

- `More unreads` indicator (with arrow) appears in channel drawer when unread channels are scrolled off-screen
- Tapping `More unreads` indicator scrolls channel list to the top
