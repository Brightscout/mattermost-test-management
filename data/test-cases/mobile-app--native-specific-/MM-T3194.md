## MM-T3194: RN apps: Channel mute - mentions and unreads

---

**Step 1**

Channel mute - mentions and unreads\
————————————————————————————

1. In a non-muted channel, have another user mention you in the channel, and verify you're receiving push notifications
2. Mute a channel, switch to viewing a different channel
3. Put the app in the background
4. Have another user mention you in the muted channel
5. Verify no push notification is received (manual verification, cannot be verified in detox)
6. View the app and open the channel drawer

**Expected**

- Push notifications NOT received for mentions in that channel
- Mention badge still appears on the channel
- Channel is in the Unreads section sorted to the top, but still appears in lighter typeface
