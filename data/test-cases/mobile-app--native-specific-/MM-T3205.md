### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Remove user from private channel<br>————————————————————————————<br>Ideally, use two devices and watch on the removed user's app / browser as they're removed from the channel to verify they are redirected to Town Square<ol><li>Tap the name of a private channel</li><li> Tap `Manage Members`</li><li> Type the beginning of a user's name in the search box</li><li>Select user and tap `Remove`</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>User is removed from channel:</li><li>Member count decrements by one</li><li>System message posts in channel for the user who removed them</li><li>If watching as the removed user, that user sees Town Square, and the channel is removed from their channel drawer list</li><li>User that was removed now also sees a message in a modal (from desktop) advising them they have been removed (if viewing channel while removed).</li></ul></article>
