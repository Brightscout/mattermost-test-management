## MM-T3251: RN apps: Set status

---

**Step 1**

Set status\
————————————————————————————

1. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right of your screen
2. Tap your status, change to away or offline
3. Have another user observe your user in the LHS DM list (or other places status displays)

**Expected**

- Other user sees your status as what you updated to (might not update immediately; can open a DM and that might help)
