### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Should display mention badges after an at-mention<br>————————————————————————————<ol><li>Have another user mention you in a channel you are not currently viewing</li><li>Do not tap the notification to view the post</li><li>Observe app icon, channel drawer, team button in channel drawer, and team sidebar</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>On some Android devices / configurations, mention badge appears on app icon.<br><strong>Also</strong>: If configured for numbered badge, app icon badge count only counts mentions, it does not count unread posts(non-mentions) and it should match the sidebar hamburger menu count.<br><br>On all devices, mention badge appears:<ul><li>on channel in channel drawer</li><li>&nbsp;on team button in channel drawer (when viewing a different team)</li><li>&nbsp;on team sidebar<br><br></li></ul><strong>Note</strong>: Mention badge will NOT appear on team button in channel drawer if the mention you received is within the same team you are currently viewing (or if it is a DM, which is technically on no team). To see the mention on the team button in the channel drawer, switch teams - it will then be visible.<br><br>App icon badge can only be verified manually.</article>
