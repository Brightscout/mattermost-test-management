### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article><ol><li>Make sure you have a teammate with their full name present in their profile.</li><li>Make sure that "ShowFullName" in config.json is set to false.</li><li>Make sure your own display preferences for Teammate Name Display are set to Show first and last name.</li><li>Have them send you a DM.</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>Verify you can't see their full first and last name in the push notification because the server settings prohibit that.</li><li>Push notifications should respect the "ShowFullName" config.json setting and prioritize it over the display settings of any regular user (admins are not really a concern).</li></ul></article>
