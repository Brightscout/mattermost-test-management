## MM-T2858: Once a scheme is applied members of the associated team see the change in permissions

---

**Step 1**

Once a scheme is applied members of the associated team see the change in permissions\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Using the steps above, create a team override scheme that differs significantly from the System Scheme and not a couple easy to spot distinctions\
2\. Associate a team to the scheme\
3\. Login as a member of that team\
4\. Observe the permissions available to the user

**Expected**

The override scheme applied to the team has affected the user's permissions
