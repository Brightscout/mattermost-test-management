## MM-T2860: Each team can only be associated with one override scheme

---

**Step 1**

Each team can only be associated with one override scheme\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Locate or create an override scheme that has at least one team associated to it and note the team\
2\. From the Permission Schemes page click edit on any other override scheme\
3\. Click Add Team and attempt to add the team noted in step 1\
4\. In the dialogue click cancel\
5\. Click on the team name again\
6\. In the dialogue click yes, move team\
7\. Click Add\
8\. Click Save

**Expected**

After 3 a dialogues opens asking if you want to move the team to the current scheme\
After 4 the team is still listed in the team selection list\
After 7 the team is now listed as one of the teams associated with the override scheme\
After 8 on the permission schemes page, you can see that the target team is no longer listed with the original scheme
