## MM-T4174: User role to channel admin/member updates channel member modal immediately without refresh

---

**Step 1**

1. Login as test user and visit town-square channel
2. Open channel menu and click "View Members"
3. On another browser, login as sysadmin and visit the same town-square channel and click channel menu > "View Members"
4. As sysadmin, demote test user as channel member and then as channel admin

**Expected**

While viewing the channel members modal, the test user should see changes on channel role immediately (without refreshing the page):\
\- when demoted to channel member, no dropdown (to change role) is available to other users\
\- when promoted to channel admin, dropdown (to change role) is available and could change other user as channel member or admin.
