### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article><ol><li>Login as test user and visit town-square channel</li><li>Open channel menu and click "View Members"</li><li>On another browser, login as sysadmin and visit the same town-square channel and click channel menu &gt; "View Members"</li><li>As sysadmin, demote test user as channel member and then as channel admin</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>While viewing the channel members modal, the test user should see changes on channel role immediately (without refreshing the page):<br />- when demoted to channel member, no dropdown (to change role) is available to other users<br />- when promoted to channel admin, dropdown (to change role) is available and could change other user as channel member or admin.<br /><br /></article>
