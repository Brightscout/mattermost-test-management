## MM-T2751: Upon being removed from LDAP entirely user has MM membership removed.

---

**Step 1**

Upon being removed from LDAP entirely user has MM membership removed.\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Identify a user who is in an LDAP group that is linked to Mm team/channel\
2\. In LDAP, remove the user from LDAP entirely / deactivated

**Expected**

User should be deactivated in Mm, like on regular LDAP sync, and trying to log in says "not registered on AD/LDAP server"\
\
User no longer appears in Group member lists in Mm\
\
(MK looking into cleaning those up if needed)
