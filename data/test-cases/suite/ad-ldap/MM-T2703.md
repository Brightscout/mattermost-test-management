**Test using an LDAP account that does not yet have an account on this Mattermost server**

2. Have an LDAP user try to create a new account using LDAP credentials, observe error message "We couldn't find an account matching your login credentials."
3. Change Login ID Attribute back to what it was before, such as \`uid\` or \`sAMAccountName\` and Save
4. Try the LDAP user account creation again

**Expected**

- After switching back to correct Login ID Attribute such as sAMAccountName, account creation is successful
