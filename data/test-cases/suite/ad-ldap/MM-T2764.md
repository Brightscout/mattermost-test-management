## MM-T2764: Public channel should not be able to be group-constrained

---

**Step 1**

Public channel should not be able to be group-constrained\
————————————————————————————

1. Try to run group channel enable on a public channel
2. Verified on team that is group-constrained and team that is not

[CLI Group Constraint command allows constraining public channels; only private is supported at this time — MM-15784](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15784)

**Expected**

- Output: "Error: Channel 'no-con-qa-team:public-channel' is not private. It cannot be group-constrained"
