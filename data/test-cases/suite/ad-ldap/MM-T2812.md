## MM-T2812: Team invite link or a team invite token for a group-constrained team only works for group members - email signin

---

**Step 1**

Team invite link or a team invite token for a group-constrained team only works for group members - email signin\
————————————————————————————

1. Copy invite link for non-constrained team
2. With the team linked to an LDAP group, enable group constraint on the team (CLI)
3. Open the invite link, click to create new account using email/password
4. Enter email/password and click to create the account

**Expected**

?? In first testing, that email/password user is joined to the group-constrained team. Not sure what the expected is, but it seems odd that they'd be allowed to join. They are indeed kicked from the team on LDAP sync, but have access in the meantime.\
