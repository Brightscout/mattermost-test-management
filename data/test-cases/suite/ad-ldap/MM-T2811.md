## MM-T2811: Team invite link or a team invite token for a group-constrained team only works for group members - LDAP signin

---

**Step 1**

Team invite link or a team invite token for a group-constrained team only works for group members - LDAP signin\
————————————————————————————

1. Copy invite link for non-constrained team
2. With the team linked to an LDAP group, enable group constraint on the team (CLI)
3. Open the invite link, click to create new account using LDAP
4. Enter LDAP credentials of a user who is a valid user in that LDAP instance but who is not in the constrain group

(**Story**) [Prevent team invite links of group-constrained teams from working for non-permitted users. — MM-14754](http://mmthttps%3A//mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14754)

**Expected**

- User account is created but user only sees teams they are allowed to join. They do not join the group-constrained team

**Note**: User who is in the group does join the group-constrained team when they create an account through the invite link
