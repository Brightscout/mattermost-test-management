## MM-T2784: Manage Groups and "Add Groups" modals for a given channel

---

**Step 1**

Manage Groups and "Add Groups" modals for a given channel\
————————————————————————————

1. Login to a group-constrained channel as user who has manage\_private\_channel\_members permission

**Expected**

- Expect to be able to view "Manage Groups" and "Add Groups" in the channel menu
- Adding and removing and searching and paging should all work
- (Tested pagination on Jumpcloud, which has enough groups to page)
