————————————————————————————

1. Ensure LDAP first and last name attributes are set in System Console
2. Log in as LDAP user
3. Go to Account Settings ➜ First and last name ➜ Edit

**Expected**

- Message appears "This field is handled through your login provider. If you want to change it, you need to do so through your login provider." and fields are not editable
