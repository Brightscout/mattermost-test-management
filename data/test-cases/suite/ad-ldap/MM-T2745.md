### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>LDAP side changes tested in v5.8 release testing<br /><br />- Make sub-group no longer a member of parent group<br />- Deactivate / remove a user in LDAP<br />- Make a group newly belong to a parent group<br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />1. Remove / deactivate linda.test in LDAP<br />2. Make abc group no longer member of developers group (should keep abc private channel, right now just carlos.test)<br />3. Make qa group member of xyz group (xyz private channel, will just be lindy.test existing acct updating on sync)<br /><br />4. sysadmin syncs LDAP in Mm (make sure SAML LDAP sync is still enabled)</article>

**Expected**

> <article>linda.test can't log in using LDAP (cleared out SAML account first, then verified; signing in first time again using SAML gets no teams)<br /><br />jesse.test sign in first time (LDAP), should get abc channel but not engineering team<br /><br />carlos.test still has abc and engineering teams<br /><br />lindy.test gets xyz team/channel</article>
