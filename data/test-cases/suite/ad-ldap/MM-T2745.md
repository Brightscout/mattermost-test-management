## MM-T2745: LDAP side changes tested in v5.8 release testing(newline)(newline)- Make sub-group no longer a member of parent group(newline)- Deactivate / remove a user in LDAP(newline)- Make a group newly belong to a parent group

**Step 1**

LDAP side changes tested in v5.8 release testing\
\
\- Make sub-group no longer a member of parent group\
\- Deactivate / remove a user in LDAP\
\- Make a group newly belong to a parent group\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Remove / deactivate linda.test in LDAP\
2\. Make abc group no longer member of developers group (should keep abc private channel, right now just carlos.test)\
3\. Make qa group member of xyz group (xyz private channel, will just be lindy.test existing acct updating on sync)\
\
4\. sysadmin syncs LDAP in Mm (make sure SAML LDAP sync is still enabled)

**Expected**

linda.test can't log in using LDAP (cleared out SAML account first, then verified; signing in first time again using SAML gets no teams)\
\
jesse.test sign in first time (LDAP), should get abc channel but not engineering team\
\
carlos.test still has abc and engineering teams\
\
lindy.test gets xyz team/channel
