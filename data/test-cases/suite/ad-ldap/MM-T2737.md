## MM-T2737: user is added to channel because of old linked group with new channel syncable.

---

**Step 1**

user is added to channel because of old linked group with new channel syncable.\
————————————————————————————\
1\. User already exists in group and Mm, and that group is already linked to at least one team\
2\. Admin links that group to another channel\
3\. User is not added to that second team / channel immediately\
4\. Admin syncs AD/LDAP

**Expected**

User is added to the newly linked team / channel on sync
