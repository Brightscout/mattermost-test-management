**Expected**

@george.test-simulator.amazonses.com and @lindy.test-simulator.amazonses.com did not get notified by this mention because they are not in the channel. Would you like to add them to this private channel? They will have access to all message history.\

@corey.test-simulator.amazonses.com and @jesse.test-simulator.amazonses.com did not get notified by this mention because they are not in the channel. They cannot be added to the channel because they are not a member of the linked groups. To add them to this channel, they must be added to the linked groups.
