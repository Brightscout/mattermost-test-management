## MM-T2739: user is added to channel and team because of old linked group with new channel syncable.

---

**Step 1**

user is added to channel and team because of old linked group with new channel syncable.\
————————————————————————————\
1\. User already exists in group and Mm, and that group is already linked to at least one team\
2\. Admin edits that group and links it to another team\
3\. Admin then selects via the channel list a channel on that same team to link\
4\. User is not added to the team immediately\
5\. Admin syncs AD/LDAP

**Expected**

User is added to the newly linked team / channel on sync
