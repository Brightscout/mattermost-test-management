————————————————————————————\
1\) Enable SAML sync with LDAP.\
2\) Upon first login user should get teams and channels.\
3\) Disable SAML sync with LDAP.\
4\) Remove user from LDAP group.\
5\) Sync: user should remain in MM group.\
6\) Enable SAML sync with LDAP, sync: user should be removed from group (but not auto-removed from team/channels)
