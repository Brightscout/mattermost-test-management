## MM-T2717: Only LDAP signin enabled Team invite carries through LDAP signin

---

**Step 1**

Only LDAP signin enabled\
\
Team invite carries through LDAP signin\
————————————————————————————\
FIRST, MAKE SURE YOU EITHER 1) have a system admin who stays logged in in a separate browser, or 2) have an LDAP user who is a system admin, so that you'll be able to get back in to the System Console

1. From the system console, disable all signin / account creation methods EXCEPT AD/LDAP
2. Switch back to a Mattermost team that is NOT open to all users on the server, and that the LDAP user is not a member of yet
3. Go to Main Menu ➜ Get Team Invite Link
4. Copy the link
5. Open an incognito window
6. Paste the link in
7. Enter LDAP credentials

**Expected**

- User is automatically redirected to login page where they can enter AD/LDAP credentials (there are no buttons to press to select an authentication method, like there are when multiple methods are enabled).
- After entering LDAP credentials, the user is joined to the (closed) team
