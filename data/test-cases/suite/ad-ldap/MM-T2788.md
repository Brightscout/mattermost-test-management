**Step 1**

LDAP sync job deletes memberships from teams and channels\
B. User was never in a group...\
1\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained channels\
2\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained teams\
————————————————————————————

1. Add a user not in groupA to a private channel on a team that is not group-constrained
2. Link that channel to groupA and enable group-constraint on the channel
3. Sync LDAP\
   \
   And:
4. Add a user not in groupA to a team
5. Link that team to groupA and enable group-constraint
6. Sync LDAP

**Expected**

1\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained channels\
2\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained teams
