## MM-T2718: Channel URL redirect - joins and displays for existing LDAP account

---

**Step 1**

Channel URL redirect - joins and displays for existing LDAP account\
————————————————————————————

1. As a user already on the server, get the URL for a \*public\* channel on an \*open\* team (make sure it's not Town Square, and ideally not the top team in the team sidebar list)
2. Log out
3. Open that URL
4. Sign in with LDAP credentials to join the team/channel

**Expected**

- User joins and sees the channel / team the link was for
