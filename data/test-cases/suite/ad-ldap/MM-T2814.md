## MM-T2814: Re-add user to constrained channel who left it

---

**Step 1**

Re-add user to constrained channel who left it\
————————————————————————————

1. lindy.test leaves Constrain-QA-Channel, logs out
2. linda.test logs in, opens Constrain-QA-Channel, uses member icon drop-down or channel menu drop-down, clicks Manage Members, Add Members, selects lindy.test and saves
3. lindy.test logs in, verifies in Constrain-QA-Channel, logs out
4. admin logs in, syncs LDAP, logs out
5. lindy.test logs in, verifies still in Constrain-QA-Channel

**Expected**

- lindy.test is added back to the channel and then isn't removed on sync
