## MM-T2787: LDAP sync job deletes memberships from teams and channels(newline)A. Remove a user from a group... (newline)1. User gets removed from associated group-constrained channels (newline)2. User gets removed from associated group-constrained teams

**Step 1**

LDAP sync job deletes memberships from teams and channels\
A. Remove a user from a group...\
1\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained channels\
2\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained teams\
————————————————————————————

1. Associate QA team with abc group
2. Associate Constrain-QA-Channel with abc group
3. Ensure both have group-constraint enabled
4. Sync LDAP, verify jesse.test is added to both
5. In LDAP instance, remove jesse.test from abc group
6. Sync LDAP

**Expected**

jesse.test is removed from both

- Still on the parent team that was not group-constrained, but removed from its group-constrained private channel
-  Removed entirely from QA team

\
**Note in first test**: jesse.test starts with just engineering team and william.test channel
