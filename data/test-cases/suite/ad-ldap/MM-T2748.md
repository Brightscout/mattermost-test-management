————————————————————————————\
1\. Identify an LDAP group that is a member of (nested in) another group, both of which have linked team/channel(s)\
2\. Identify a Mm user who signs in using LDAP but is not in the group identified in step 1\
3\. In LDAP, add the user to the group identified in step 1\
4\. Admin sync LDAP

**Expected**

Added to team/channel on sync\

User appears in the user list on that Group's page in Mm and also in the user list on the Group that it's a member of (nested in)
