Apply E20 license, set up at least one group link with team/channel<br />2. New user signs in for the first time using LDAP, gets linked team/channel(s)<br />3. Admin links an additional team/channel, does NOT sync<br />4. Admin removes E20 license (LDAP sync no longer available in UI)<br />5. User from step 2 logs out and cannot log back in because LDAP is not available</article>

**Expected**
