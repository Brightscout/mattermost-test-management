## MM-T2760: Group sync does not occur on TE

---

**Step 1**

Group sync does not occur on TE\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Apply E20 license, set up at least one group link with team/channel\
2\. New user signs in for the first time using LDAP, gets linked team/channel(s)\
3\. Admin links an additional team/channel, does NOT sync\
4\. Admin removes E20 license (LDAP sync no longer available in UI)\
5\. User from step 2 logs out and cannot log back in because LDAP is not available

**Expected**

Even if previously licensed and group links were set up, if server is currently unlicensed (TE), LDAP is not available in System Console or for login
