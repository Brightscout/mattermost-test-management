### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Shouldn't see Manage Members in channel drop-down<br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />(right?)<br /><br />Note: False alarms due to my temporary confusion (these are all expected, as a member of a constrained team could leave / be added to, say, Off-Topic on that team):<br />3. Constrained team: Off-Topic link at top of channel `Invite others to this channel` ➜ Add new members modal<br />4. Constrained team: Off-Topic channel drop-down has Add Members and Manage Members<br />5. Constrained team: Off-Topic member icon drop-down has Manage Members</article>

**Expected**

> <article>ASK MARTIN:<br />Seeing some member management that perhaps shouldn't be visible? Only visible when that user would normally have permissions in a non-constrained channel/team. But still, can't actually add or remove; just strange to see some Manage Members options visible in menus:<br />1. Constrained channel: channel drop-down ➜ Manage Members ➜ Add Members (no one available to add, but the options are there to click through)<br />2. Constrained channel: member icon drop-down ➜ Manage Members ➜ Add Members (no one available to add, but the options are there to click through)<br />3. Constrained team: Main Menu ➜ Manage Members (should say View Members?)</article>
