## MM-T2732: With the ID Attribute set - ID Attribute modified so that it does match

---

**Step 1**

With the ID Attribute set - ID Attribute modified so that it does match\
————————————————————————————

1. In OKTA change the first name (since we set idAttr to that) to match the uid in LDAP (uid=Test.One) and Save
2. Have that same user try to log in to Mm using OKTA

**Expected**

- Login is successful, logs back in to the old account
