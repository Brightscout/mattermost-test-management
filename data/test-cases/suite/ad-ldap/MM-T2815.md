## MM-T2815: Verify differences between linked but non-constrained and constrained when adding users to channel or team (and searching in the Add Members modal)

---

**Step 1**

Verify differences between linked but non-constrained and constrained when adding users to channel or team (and searching in the Add Members modal)\
————————————————————————————\
**On an instance with LDAP sync enabled**:

1. Associate a group with a channel
2. Trigger a LDAP sync, so all the group members join the channel
3. Remove at least one member of the group from the channel
4. Click on the channel name ➜ Add members so the Add New Members to channel modal is shown
5. Search for a user

**Expected**

- After 4 and 5, in the Add Members dialog, all the users outside the channel should be shown (the member that was removed and those not members of the group), and the search should be able to find and filter them

---

**Step 2**

1. Enable group constraint for the channel
2. Click on the channel name ➜ Add members
3. Search for a user
4. REPEAT for team

**Expected**

- After 2 and 3, in the Add Members dialog, only the members of the group that were removed should be shown, and when searching, only they should appear in the results
