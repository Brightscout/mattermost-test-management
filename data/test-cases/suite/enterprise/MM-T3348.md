**Step 1**

> <article>1. Login as sysadmin and visit System Console &gt; Permissions page.<br>2. Verify if there is a new permission added to "Convert channels" under "Manage Public Channels".

Check the "Convert Channels" option for All Members and save. Login as a regular member and check if the user is allowed to convert a public channel to private channel. <br><br></article>
