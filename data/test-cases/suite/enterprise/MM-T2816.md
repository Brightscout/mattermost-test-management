## MM-T2816: Request a Trial License on E0 instance

---

**Step 1**

1. On an E0 instance, go to the admin console, in the license/edition section
2. If you have a license remove it.
3. Request a trial license.
4. Verify that you get a valid license for the next month with at least 36 users, or a 20% more users than the ones that you have in your system.
