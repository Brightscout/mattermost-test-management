## MM-T3145: Check for Filter in Members block of Team Configuration page

---

**Step 1**

Check for Filter in Members block of Team Configuration page\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click on a Team which has few members in System Console ➜ Teams page.
2. Check if the option to apply Filters is displayed in the Members section.
3. Select one Role and check if only members of that role are displayed.
4. Select 2 roles and check if members of both the roles are displayed.
5. Search for a user with 2 roles applied and check that the search result shows users belonging to the 2 roles applied.
6. Click on Reset Filters and check if all the roles are cleared. The search term should not be cleared though.

**Expected**

**After 2**: Option to apply Filters should be shown with options like Guest, Member, Team Admin and System Admin.\
**Note**: Guest should not be shown if Guest Access is disabled.\
\
**After 3:** If one role is filtered, only members related to that role should be shown.\
\
**After 4**: If two roles are selected, only members related to both the role should be shown.\
\
**After 5**: Results should show users matching the search term and filter applied. If no results, then it should display "No users found"\
\
**After 6**: Clicking on reset filters should only clear the filters. It should not clear the search term.
