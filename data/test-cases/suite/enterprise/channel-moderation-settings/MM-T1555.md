**Expected**

3\. Option to allow Channel Mentions for Guests should also be disabled when Create Post option is disabled. A message "Guests can not use channel mentions without the ability to create posts" should be displayed.\
5\. Option to allow Channel Mentions for Members should also be disabled when Create Post option is disabled. A message "Members can not use channel mentions without the ability to create posts" should be displayed.\
If both Guests & Members are disabled, then the message should read like:\
"Guests & Members can not use channel mentions without the ability to create posts"
