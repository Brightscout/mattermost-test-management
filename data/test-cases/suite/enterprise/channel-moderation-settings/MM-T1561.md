## MM-T1561: Effect of changing Team Override Schemes on a Channel for which Channel Moderation Settings was never modified

**Objective**

Effect of changing Team Override Schemes on a Channel for which Channel Moderation Settings was never modified

**Precondition**

None

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as sysadmin & Add a new Team Override Scheme for a team and remove the option to use Manage Members for Members & Save.\
2\. Visit the Channels page and click on a channel (belonging to a team used in step 1).\
3\. Check if the option to allow Manage Members for Members should be disabled.\
4\. Login as a Regular Member and visit the same channel.\
5\. Check if the user has the permission to add or remove people in the channel.

- (**Story**) [Add E2E tests + Unit tests for Channel Moderation Widget — MM-23102](http://mmthttps%3A//mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23102)

**Expected**

Any changes to the Team Override Scheme should also be propagated down to Channel Moderation Settings for individual channels.\
6\. Hence the option to allow Manage Members for Members should also be disabled in Channel Moderation Settings when changed in Team Override Scheme.\
8\. Regular Member should not be able to add or remove people in the channel when its removed from the Team Override Scheme.
