### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Login as sysadmin &amp; Add a new Team Override Scheme for a team and remove the option to use Manage Members for Members &amp; Save. <br />2. Visit the Channels page and click on a channel (belonging to a team used in step 1). <br />3. Check if the option to allow Manage Members for Members should be disabled. <br />4. Login as a Regular Member and visit the same channel. <br />5. Check if the user has the permission to add or remove people in the channel.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Any changes to the Team Override Scheme should also be propagated down to Channel Moderation Settings for individual channels. <br />6. Hence the option to allow Manage Members for Members should also be disabled in Channel Moderation Settings when changed in Team Override Scheme. <br />8. Regular Member should not be able to add or remove people in the channel when its removed from the Team Override Scheme.</article>
