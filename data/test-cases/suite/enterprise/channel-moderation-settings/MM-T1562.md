---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as sysadmin and visit the Channels page and click on a channel.\
2\. Uncheck the option to Manage Members for Members and save.\
3\. Check the option to Manage Members for Members and save.\
4\. Add a new Team Override Scheme for the same team (as used in step 2) and remove the option to use Manage Members for Members & Save.\
5\. Visit the Channels page and click on the same channel (as used in step 2).\
6\. Check if the option to allow Manage Members for Members should be disabled.\
7\. Login as a Regular Member and visit the same channel.\
8\. Check if the user has the permission to add or remove people in the channel.

**Expected**

Any changes to the Team Override Scheme should also be propagated down to Channel Moderation Settings for individual channels.\
6\. Hence the option to allow Manage Members for Members should also be disabled in Channel Moderation Settings when changed in Team Override Scheme.\
8\. Regular Member should not be able to add or remove people in the channel when its removed from the Team Override Scheme.
