### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Login as sysadmin and Edit the System Scheme and remove the option to use Manage Members for Members &amp; Save. <br />5. Visit the Channels page and click on a channel (which was not modified before). <br />6. Check if the option to allow Manage Members for Members should be disabled. <br />7. Login as a Regular Member and visit the same channel. <br />8. Check if the user has the permission to add or remove people in the channel.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Any changes to System Scheme should also be propagated down to Channel Moderation Settings for individual channels. <br />6. Hence the option to allow Manage Members for Members should also be disabled in Channel Moderation Settings when changed in System Scheme. <br />8. Regular Member should not be able to add or remove people in the channel when its removed from the System Scheme.</article>
