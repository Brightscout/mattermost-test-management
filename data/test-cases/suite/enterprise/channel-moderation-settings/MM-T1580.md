## MM-T1580: Permissions inherited when channel converted from Public to Private

**Objective**

Permissions inherited when channel converted from Public to Private

**Precondition**

None

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as sysadmin and create a new Team Override Scheme for a team and remove the option to Manage Members for Private Channels for All Members.\
2\. Ensure option to Manage Members for Public Channels is still allowed for All Members.\
3\. Visit a Public Channel and check the Channel Moderation Settings.\
4\. Convert the channel to Private Channel and now check the Moderation Settings.

**Expected**

When a channel is converted from Public to Private (or vice versa), the permissions should be inherited from it's higher scoped and should be updated immediately.\
Hence if a public channel is converted to private channel, the Manage Members option should be disabled and unchecked and a message indicating "Manage Members for members are disabled in Team Scheme" should be displayed.
