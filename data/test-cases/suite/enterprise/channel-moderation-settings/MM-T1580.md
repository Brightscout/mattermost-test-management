### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Login as sysadmin and create a new Team Override Scheme for a team and remove the option to Manage Members for Private Channels for All Members. <br />2. Ensure option to Manage Members for Public Channels is still allowed for All Members.<br />3. Visit a Public Channel and check the Channel Moderation Settings. <br />4. Convert the channel to Private Channel and now check the Moderation Settings.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>When a channel is converted from Public to Private (or vice versa), the permissions should be inherited from it's higher scoped and should be updated immediately. <br />Hence if a public channel is converted to private channel, the Manage Members option should be disabled and unchecked and a message indicating &quot;Manage Members for members are disabled in Team Scheme&quot; should be displayed.</article>
