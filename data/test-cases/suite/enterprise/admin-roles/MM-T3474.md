## MM-T3474: Change Permissions - Admin Roles - System User Manager

**Objective**

Change Permissions - Admin Roles - System User Manager

---

**Step 1**

1\. Using mmctl add the following permissions to System User Manager Role by running the following command:\
\
go run mmctl.go permissions add system\_user\_manager sysconsole\_write\_site\
go run mmctl.go permissions add system\_user\_manager sysconsole\_read\_plugins\
\
2\. Login as Sysadmin and visit System Console > System Roles page.\
3\. Click on System User Manager Role and check if the following new permission sections are shown:\\

- Site Configuration > Read + Write
- Plugins > Read

4\. Set the section User Management to None and save and reload and check if User Management section is still displayed.\
5\. Set the section Site Configuration to None and save and reload and check if Site Configuration section is not displayed after reload.

**Expected**

- Additional sections should be displayed for System User Manager role based on whatever permissions are added via mmctl
- Default sections, i.e. User Management and Authentication should not be removed even if Sysadmin sets it to None and saves and reloads the page.
- Additional sections like Site Configuration should be removed if sysadmin sets it to None and saves and reloads the page.
