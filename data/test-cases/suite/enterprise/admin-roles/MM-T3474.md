\
2\. Login as Sysadmin and visit System Console > System Roles page.\
3\. Click on System User Manager Role and check if the following new permission sections are shown:

- Site Configuration > Read + Write
- Plugins > Read

4\. Set the section User Management to None and save and reload and check if User Management section is still displayed.\
