2\. Click on the system\_user\_manager admin role and add a user.\
3\. Login as the system\_user\_manager and visit System Console.\
4\. Check if the user has the permissions in different screens based on the permissions selected in System Roles > System User Manager screen. For example:\
\\

|                               |              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| About                         | None         |
| Reporting                     | None         |
| User Management > Users       | None         |
| User Management > Groups      | Read + Write |
| User Management > Teams       | Read + Write |
| User Management > Channels    | Read + Write |
| User Management > Permissions | Read         |
| Environment                   | None         |
| Site Configuratioon           | None         |
| Authentication                | Read         |
| Plugins                       | None         |
| Integrations                  | None         |
| Compliance                    | None         |
| Experimental                  | None         |

**Expected**

User should be able to access the different screens as per the permissions defined in the test. Here is the brief of these permissions:\
\
**None** - User should not be able to view the screen\
\
**Read** - User should be able to only view the data in that screen. User should not be able to modify anything\
\
**Read+Write** - User should be allowed to view and modify the data in the corresponding screen. User should not receive any error when data is modified and saved.
