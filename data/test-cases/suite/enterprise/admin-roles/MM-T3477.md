## MM-T3477: Change Permissions - User Management > System Roles

**Objective**

Change Permissions - User Management > System Roles

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as Sysadmin and visit System Console > System Roles page.\
2\. Click on each of the following roles and check if the User Management > System Roles permission is always set to "No Access" and sysadmin should not be allowed to change this dropdown and it should not be editable.

- System Manager
- System User Manager
- Read Only Admin

3\. Click on the permissions dropdown for User Management and select "Can Edit" and notice that the System Roles permission should remain as "No Access"

**Expected**

System Roles permission should not be assignable to any of the System Roles and should always be "No Access". Only sysadmin should have this permission enabled
