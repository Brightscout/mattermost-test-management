a. This should work without requiring the user to reload the page.\
4\. As a guest user, submit a post containing a group mention which is enabled\
a. It should not notify the group members and should not display any system messages and the group mention should not be highlighted\
5\. Now as a sysadmin, enable the Group Mentions permission for Guest Users but disable it for All Members in System Scheme.\
a. Check if a guest user types @ in a post, Group1 should be displayed in the autocomplete suggestions list.\
b. When guest user submits a post containing the group mention, it should notify the group members and the group mention should be highlighted
