## MM-T2459: Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel when Manage Members is disabled

**Objective**

Check Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel when Manage Members is disabled

**Precondition**

None

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable Group Mention for a group say Group1.\
2\. Ensure some members of that group are present in a team Team1 but not in the channel Channel1.\
3\. Remove the Manage Members option for Members for Channel1 in Channel Moderation Settings.\
4\. As a regular user, navigate to Channel1 and submit a post containing the group mention Group1.\
5\. The regular user should get a system message indicating that the list of members of the group were not notified by this mention because they are not in the channel.\
a. Option should not be given to add the members to the channel since the user does not has permissions to do the same.\
b. The list of missing members in the system message should be clickable

**Expected**

Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel when Manage Members is disabled should be working fine as expected
