### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Enable Group Mention for a group say Group1.<br />    2. Ensure some members of that group are present in a team Team1 but not in the channel Channel1. <br />    3. Remove the Manage Members option for Members for Channel1 in Channel Moderation Settings. <br />    4. As a regular user, navigate to Channel1 and submit a post containing the group mention Group1. <br />    5. The regular user should get a system message indicating that the list of members of the group were not notified by this mention because they are not in the channel. <br />        a. Option should not be given to add the members to the channel since the user does not has permissions to do the same. <br />        b. The list of missing members in the system message should be clickable</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel when Manage Members is disabled should be working fine as expected</article>
