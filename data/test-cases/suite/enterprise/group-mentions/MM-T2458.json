As a guest user, navigate to Channel1 and submit a post containing the group mention Group1. <br />    5. The guest user should get a system message indicating that the list of members of the group were not notified by this mention because they are not in the channel. <br />        a. Option should not be given to add the members to the channel since the user does not has permissions to do the same. <br />        b.
