## MM-T2458: Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel as a Guest User

**Objective**

Check Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel as a Guest User

**Precondition**

None

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable Group Mention for a group say Group1.\
2\. Ensure some members of that group are present in a team Team1 but not in the channel Channel1.\
3\. Ensure a Guest User is added to the channel Channel1 and does not has access to any other channels in that team.\
4\. As a guest user, navigate to Channel1 and submit a post containing the group mention Group1.\
5\. The guest user should get a system message indicating that the list of members of the group were not notified by this mention because they are not in the channel.\
a. Option should not be given to add the members to the channel since the user does not has permissions to do the same.\
b. The list of missing members in the system message should not be clickable

**Expected**

Group Mentions when group members are not in the channel as a Guest User should be working fine as expected
