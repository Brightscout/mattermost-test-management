<hr/>

**Step 1**

Check if regular member types @ in a post, Group1 should not be displayed in the autocomplete suggestions list. <br />        a. This should work without requiring the regular member to reload the page. <br />    4. Submit a post containing the group mention which is disabled<br />        a. It should not notify the group members and should not display any system messages and the group mention should not be highlighted</article>
