2\. As a sysadmin, unlink the group without disabling the group mention.\
3\. Check if regular member types @ in a post, Group1 should not be displayed in the autocomplete suggestions list.\
a. This should work without requiring the regular member to reload the page.\
4\. Submit a post containing the group mention which is disabled\
a. It should not notify the group members and should not display any system messages and the group mention should not be highlighted
