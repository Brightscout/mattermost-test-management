**Step 1**

> <article>MFA - Enforced<br>–––––––––––––––––––––––––<br><strong>First</strong>: <span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">Ensure you already have MFA set up on a separate **system admin** account on the server, in case an issue arises and you need to get back in to System Console to disable MFA enforcement.</span><ol><li>In a separate browser, log in a user *other than* the system admin you're going to use to change the settings</li><li>Ensure the system admin you're using to change the setting has MFA set up, and can use it to log in</li><li>System admin: Enable MFA enforcement in System Console ➜ MFA</li><li>Observe the other account in the other browser immediately sees the MFA setup page</li><li>Have the other user click in the top left to log out</li><li>Have the other user enter email/password to sign in</li><li>Observe the other user sees the MFA setup page</li><li>Be sure to remove enforcement after this test</li></ol></article>
