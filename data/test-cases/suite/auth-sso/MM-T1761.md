---

**Step 1**

Enable Open Server - Create link appears if email account creation is false and other signin methods are true\
————————————————————————————\
1\) In System Console> Authentication > Email, set Enable account creation with email = False\
2\) In System Console> Authentication > OAuth 2.0, select Office365 (or 'do not allow signin via an OAuth provider').\
3\) System Console> Security > Sign Up, set Enable Open Server = True\
4\) In System Console > Authentication, enable SAML and LDAP

**Expected**

Don't have an account? Create one now appears since the server is open
