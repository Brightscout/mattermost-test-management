## MM-T1765: Authentication - Email - Creation with email = false

---

**Step 1**

Authentication - Email - Creation with email = false\
————————————————————————————\
1\. "Enable account creation with email:" = false\
2\. Save\
3\. Attempt to create a new account via "Get Team Invite Link"

**Expected**

There should be no option to enter an email address. If GitLab/Google/Office 365 SSO, AD/LDAP or SAML is turned on, that should be the only option for user creation.
