3. If needed, set System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup ➜ \`Enable open server\` to true, then create a new account on another browser/device (use a valid email address you have access to)

4. Verify you are brought directly to team selection page / tutorial / Town Square (depending on signup method and settings)

5. System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Email ➜ "Require Email Verification" = true

6. Save

7. New user log out and back in. Log in using {username} rather than email address, if username is enabled for login (otherwise email is fine)

8. See Almost Done page, click \`Resend email\`, see green success message "Verification email sent."

9. Check your email, click in the email message to verify your email address, then log in
