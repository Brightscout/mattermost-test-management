**Step 1**

Security - Signup: Email verification not required\
————————————————————————————\
1\. "Require Email Verification" = false\
2\. Save\
3\. If needed, set server to be open, then create new account (use a valid email address you have access to, for following test)

**Expected**

New account is taken directly to team selection page or Town Square, depending on how account was created\
\
(Email is still received, but verification is not required in order to join a team and use Mm)
