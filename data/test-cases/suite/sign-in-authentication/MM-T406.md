### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>--------------------<br>On a server with site URL and email settings configured (such as rc.test.mattermost.com):<br>1. Go to the login page where you enter username &amp; password<br>2. Verify focus is in first login field (N/A for RN)<br>3. Click "I forgot my password"<br>4. Enter an email that doesn't have an account on the server (but that you CAN receive email at)</article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>User redirected to a page with message</li><li>"If the account exists, a password reset email will be sent to: [email address]. Please check your inbox."</li><li>Email is not received (presuming site URL and email have been set up on this server; otherwise this test is invalid because email wouldn't be sent even if that email address had an account)</li><li>RN: The first login field is not focused on mobile, this is expected</li></ul></article>
