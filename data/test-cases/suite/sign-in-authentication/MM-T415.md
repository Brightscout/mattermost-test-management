**Step 1**

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As UserA, launch the mobile app
2. Make a post to ensure connectivity
3. Place device in airplane mode
   \
   (UserA sees "No internet connection" grey bar at top)
4. As UserB, make a post to a channel/team that UserA is a member of
5. UserA, take device out of airplane mode

**Expected**

- UserA sees

  - "connecting..." grey bar/spinner
  - "connected" green bar

- UserA should **not** see "Refreshing messages failed. Pull up to try again" orange bar after messages have loaded in the channel
