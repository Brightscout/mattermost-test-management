## MM-T405: MFA - Remove

---

**Step 1**

MFA - Remove\
\--------------------\
Ensure MFA is enabled but not enforced (System Console > MFA)\
\
1\. Sign in with an account using Email Authentication and MFA\
2\. Go to Account Settings > Security > Multi-factor Authentication > Edit\
3\. Remove MFA (would say "Reset" if MFA enforcement is on for the server)\
4\. Log out\
5\. Log in again

_Related ticket(s):_

Unscheduled improvement to warn when removing MFA:\
<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-11635>

**Expected**

Login should be successful without having to enter an MFA code.\
\
(If MFA is enforced and you clicked "Reset" MFA, you should be immediately prompted to re-add it.)
