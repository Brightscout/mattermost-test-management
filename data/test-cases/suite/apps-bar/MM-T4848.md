## MM-T4848: Plugins that have not been migrated to the App Bar will show existing icons moved over to the App Bar as expected.

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable App Bar on your Mattermost server\
2\. Install and enable plugins that have not had the icon migrated to the App Bar component (Zoom 1.5.1 for example)

**Expected**

\- Channel header icons are moved over to the App Bar as expected\
\- Icons are all functional and show visual feedback when clicked
