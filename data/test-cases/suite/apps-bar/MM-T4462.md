2\. Deploy a build of the Zendesk App\
3\. Install the Zendesk App

**Expected**

\- The Zendesk App is shown in the Apps bar header\
\- The icon opens a modal when click (\*\*note:Â \*\*The user will see a message that subscriptions are unavailable if they click the icon without a subscription target setup)
