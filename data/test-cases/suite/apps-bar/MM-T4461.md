## MM-T4461: Apps such as Zendesk works in channel header when App bar is disabled

---

**Step 1**

1\. Start your server with the Feature Flag for the Apps Bar in a False state `_MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AppBarEnabled=false_`\
2\. Deploy a build of the Zendesk App\
3\. Install the Zendesk App

**Expected**

\- The Zendesk App is shown in the channel header\
\- The icon opens a modal when click (\*\*note: \*\*The user will see a message that subscriptions are unavailable if they click the icon without a subscription target setup)
