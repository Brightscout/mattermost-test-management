## MM-T400: Create account from login page link using email-password

---

**Step 1**

Create account from login page link using email-password\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Ensure that System Console ➜ AUTHENTICATION ➜ SIGN-UP ➜ ENABLE OPEN SERVER is TRUE (you're all set if the login page has a "Create one now" link)
2. On the sign in page, click "Don't have an account? Create one now"
3. Click "Email and password"
4. Enter email credentials for a new account
5. Click "Create Account"
6. Check your email for a verification email
7. Click the "Verify" link

_Important notes about this step:_

​​​​**Won't fix**: Older Edge versions don't appear to sign up successfully (but do sign up): [](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-7363) <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-7363>

**Expected**

- Email verification is successful and account is created.
- All except for mobile: On the login page, email is pre-filled with focus on the password field.
