**Step 1**

- Observe that it redirects to a landing page ("\<site\_url>/landing#") where it shows "Where would you like to view this?"

2\. When a user click "View in Desktop App"

- The Desktop App should open and be able to log in

3\. When a user click "View in Browser"

- The user should continue in browser and be able to log in

4\. When a user click "Download the app now", it should redirect to a link based on Â "NativeAppSettings.AppDownloadLink" config setting
