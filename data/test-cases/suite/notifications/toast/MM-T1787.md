## MM-T1787: Toast does not appear when all new messages are visible without scrolling down

**Step 1**

Toast does not appear when all new messages are visible without scrolling down\
————————————————————————————

1. As the test user read all messages in a channel then switch away
2. Have another user make 1 or 2 short posts in a channel
3.  As the test user reopen the channel
4. Scroll up
