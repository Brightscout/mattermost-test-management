## MM-T1786: Dismissing the toast using Jump to

---

**Step 1**

Dismissing the toast using Jump to\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Navigate to an unread channel with New Messages toast
2. Click on Jump to Recents (or anywhere on the toast, excluding x area)

**Expected**

- As user clicks on "jump to", the entire toast clears before the user hits the bottom of the channel, smooth transition to fade of the toast before/at the time the user hits the bottom of the channel.
- No delay when a user hits the bottom of the screen
