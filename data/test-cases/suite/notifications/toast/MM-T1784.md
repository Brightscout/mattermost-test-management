## MM-T1784: View new messages toast

---

**Step 1**

View new messages toast\
————————————————————————————

1. Have a channel with more than a page of unread messages (have another user post around 30 messages)
2. Switch to the channel

**Expected**

- See a toast with Jump to recent messages button

---

**Step 2**

————————————————————————————

1. Have another user post couple of posts in channelA
2. Switch to the channelA

**Expected**

- See a toast with number the unread messages in the toast if the bottom is not in view

There should not be a toast if all new messages and bottom of channel are in view

---

**Step 3**

————————————————————————————

1. Navigate to channel with unread messages
2.  Scroll up to preserve the toast (so it does not dismiss)
3. Open the RHS reply thread on any post
4. Shrink the window to smaller size until mobile view is present

**Expected**

- As window width gets smaller toast should drop the timestamp and show the mobile view version of the toast - just the message count, arrow and x.
- Note: It is expected that in between wide view and narrow view the center channel may "slide under" the RHS a bit, including the toast. That is okay. It should resolve itself and be legible again once you reach narrow mobile view.

---

**Step 4**

————————————————————————————

1. Mark a channel as unread, switch away from the channel, then back.
2. Scroll up a channel and someone else posts a message to the channel

**Expected**

- New message toast is present with the count. Count increments as new messages are posted
