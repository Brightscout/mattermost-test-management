## MM-T505: Email Notifications Batching On - Batched email not sent if active in Mm within the 15 minutes

---

**Step 1**

–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Note**: Ensure Email Batching is "true" in the System Console ➜ Notifications ➜ Email Section (or you won't see the \`15 minutes\` option)\
\
Also ensure your status is set to Away or Offline (can set from drop-down in top left or use /away or /offline)

1. Click the hamburger menu to the right of the team name in the LHS
2. Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"
3. Click "Edit‚" to the right of "Email Notifications"
4. Select "15 minutes"
5. Click "Save"
6. Have another user send some mentions and direct messages that would trigger an email notification
7. Before the 15 minutes elapses, switch channels a couple times (don't necessarily have to read the specific DMs or mentions; any activity in Mattermost counts)

**Expected**

- Email notification is not sent (it's canceled by having been active in Mattermost)
- Be sure to go back and check your email after 15 minutes as well, to make sure it didn't end up sending
