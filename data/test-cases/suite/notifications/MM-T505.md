### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>–––––––––––––––––––––––––<br><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure Email Batching is "true" in the System Console ➜ Notifications ➜ Email Section (or you won't see the `15 minutes` option)<br><br>Also ensure your status is set to Away or Offline (can set from drop-down in top left or use /away or /offline)<br><br><ol><li>Click the hamburger menu to the right of the team name in the LHS</li><li>Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"</li><li>Click "Edit‚" to the right of "Email Notifications"</li><li>Select "15 minutes"</li><li>Click "Save"</li><li>Have another user send some mentions and direct messages that would trigger an email notification</li><li>Before the 15 minutes elapses, switch channels a couple times (don't necessarily have to read the specific DMs or mentions; any activity in Mattermost counts)</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>Email notification is not sent (it's canceled by having been active in Mattermost)</li><li>Be sure to go back and check your email after 15 minutes as well, to make sure it didn't end up sending</li></ul></article>
