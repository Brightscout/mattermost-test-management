## MM-T1573: Two mobile 'in-app' (while app is open) notifications received in quick succession display one after one the other

---

**Step 1**

Two mobile 'in-app' (while app is open) notifications received in quick succession display one after one the other\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. On mobile app, view channelA (we'll call you userA)
2. Ensure three-dot menu ➜ Settings ➜ Notifications ➜ Mobile ➜ Trigger push notifications when is set to `Online, away or offline`
3. As another userB, log in to that same team, and view a different channelB
4. Ensure userA is in that channelB, or add them to it
5. While viewing mobile app as userA, have userB post `@all` in that channelB twice in quick succession

- The app does not hang or crash
