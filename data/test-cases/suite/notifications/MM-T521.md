## MM-T521: RN apps: Push notification does not clear notification from last channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Open a channel - Channel A and place the app in the background
2. As another user Mention test user in Channel A and another channel - Channel B
3. As test user tap the notification from Channel B

[RN: Tapping on a push notification doesn't open the correct channel â€” MM-24639](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-24639)

**Expected**

- The app opens and re-directs the user to channel B
- Channel A still has the mention badge showing in the channel drawer
