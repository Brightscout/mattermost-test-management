**Step 1**

Words that trigger mentions - First name case-matching\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

2. Ensure a first name is set in Account Settings ➜ Full Name
3. Go to Account Settings ➜ Notifications ➜ Words that trigger mentions ➜ Edit
4. Select "Your case sensitive first name \[name]"
5. Uncheck "Your non-case sensitive username \[name]"
6. Click "Save"
7. Use another account to post a message with your first name with matching case, and another message with your first name not matching case

_Important notes about this step:_

Doesn't work if first name is more than one word

- You do not receive notifications when your first name with non-matching case is mentioned.
- Mention terms are highlighted.
