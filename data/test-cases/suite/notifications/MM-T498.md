_Important notes about this step:_

Some browsers like Edge and Firefox don't allow sound configuration in Account Settings; help text directs all users to configure sound settings in their browser.

**Test Data**

**Windows OS**:

- System sound may also play; has to be disabled separately in the OS. May be variations based on whether window is in focus as well.

**Firefox Note**:

- Verify settings if needed by going to Preferences ➜ Privacy & Security ➜ Permissions ➜ Notifications and make sure the server you are on is not blocked
- Also, there may be an address bar text bubble (left side) permission warning that needs to be actioned

**Expected**

- Step 4. - Single desktop notification sounds plays automatically as preview
- Selected Desktop Notification Sounds plays when notification/mention is received
  \
  (Not Edge, see note below)

**Step 2**

1. Open Desktop Notifications in Account Settings again and ensure Notification sound is On
2. Click on the dropdown to change the notification sound, click on a different sound to select it  e.g. Ripple
3. Save
4. Receive a notification/mention 
5. Open Notifications again, click on notification sound dropdown to open, arrow up or down to select the sound option and  press ‘return’ to select and close the drop-down list.
