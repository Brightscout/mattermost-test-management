**Step 1**

Email Notifications\
No Batching - Mentions and DMs while away\

\
Also ensure your status is set to Away or Offline (can set from drop-down in top left or use /away or /offline)\
\

2\. Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"\
3\. Click ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù to the right of ‚ÄúEmail Notifications‚Äù\
4\. Select "Immediately"\
5\. Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù\
6\. Using drop-down status indicator on profile pic in top left, set status to Away (Mobile apps set status to Away by posting `/away`)
