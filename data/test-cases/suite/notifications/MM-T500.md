---

**Step 1**

Email Notifications\
No Batching - Mentions and DMs while away\
\--------------------\

\
Also ensure your status is set to Away or Offline (can set from drop-down in top left or use /away or /offline)\
\
1\. Click on the hamburger main menu to the right of the team name in the LHS\
2\. Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"\
3\. Click ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù to the right of ‚ÄúEmail Notifications‚Äù\
4\. Select "Immediately"\
5\. Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù\
6\. Using drop-down status indicator on profile pic in top left, set status to Away (Mobile apps set status to Away by posting `/away`)

**Test Data**

\- The subject line of the email should display a channel name\
\- Include a GM and channel mention and ensure that email subject is consistent with teammate name display setting\
\- The link to the post in the email brings you to the post
