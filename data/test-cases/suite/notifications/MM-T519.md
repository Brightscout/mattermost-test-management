**Precondition**

\
**Also ensure that within iOS Settings, your Mattermost app notifications setting is set to Automatic (not "By app")**

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: iOS ONLY - iOS 12 or newer - Notifications grouped by channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right of your screen
2. Tap "Settings", then "Notifications"
3. Tap "Mobile"
4. Ensure set to "For all activity" and "Online, away, or offline"
5. Go back to channel view and put app in background or lock screen
6. Have another user post several messages, in various channels, with some channels having multiple messages
7. Observe that notifications are grouped by channel
8. Swipe left on one of the groupings, observe the options to view, clear, or manage settings
9. Tap to open one of the notifications other than the most recent one

**Test Data**

**Must test on iOS 12 or newer (mark test as Blocked if you don't have iOS 12+ available to test on, and make a note in Actual Test Results)**\
\
**Also ensure that within iOS Settings, your Mattermost app notifications setting is set to Automatic (not "By app")**

**Expected**

- Multiple notifications are grouped on the screen based on the channel they're in
- Opening the app from one of the grouped notifications, not the most recently received, opens the app to the channel the notification came from
