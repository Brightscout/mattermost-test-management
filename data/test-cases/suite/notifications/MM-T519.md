**Test Data**

> <article><strong><span style="color:rgb(184, 49, 47)">Must test on iOS 12 or newer (mark test as Blocked if you don't have iOS 12+ available to test on, and make a note in Actual Test Results)</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color:rgb(184, 49, 47)">Also ensure that within iOS Settings, your Mattermost app notifications setting is set to Automatic (not "By app") <br /></span></strong></article>
