## MM-T499: Desktop Notification Sounds OFF

**Precondition**

In Windows OS, system sound may also play; has to be disabled separately in the OS. May be variations based on whether window is in focus as well.

---

**Step 1**

Desktop Notification Sounds OFF\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click on the hamburger menu to the right of the team name in the LHS
2.  Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"
3.  Click "Edit" to the right of "Desktop Notification Sounds"
4.  Select "Off"
5. Click "Save"
6. Receive notification/mention

_Important notes about this step:_

- In Windows OS, system sound may also play; has to be disabled separately in the OS. May be variations based on whether window is in focus as well.
- Some browsers like Edge and Firefox don't allow sound configuration in Account Settings; help text directs all users to configure sound settings in their browser.

**Expected**

- Desktop Notification Sounds do not play
  \
  (Not Edge or Firefox; see note below)
- If the "Off" radio button is selected the drop-down sound list will be hidden
