**Step 1**

1. Go to Main Menu ➜ Account Settings ➜ Notifications ➜ Desktop Notifications and set it to "Only for mentions and direct messages"
2. Log out, wait a couple minutes, then:
3. Log in with another account
4. Send a message \[at]here
5. Log back in with the main account

**Expected**

- There should be no mention indicator on the channel @here was sent in, although @here will be highlighted and the channel will be marked as unread. No email notification should be received.
