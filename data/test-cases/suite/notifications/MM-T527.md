## MM-T527: Mobile app icon notification badge increments number up for each mention and down when reply is sent from notification

**Precondition**

**N/A until **[**https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23867**](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23867)** is resolved**

**Step 1**

Mobile app icon notification badge increments number up for each mention and down when reply is sent from notification\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**On mobile app**:

1. As user A, be a member of 3 channels: Town Square, Off Topic, and one other one
2. View the other channel (so you're not in the channels you're getting mentions in)
3. Return to the home screen (launcher)
4. Have a User B mention you once in Town Square
5. Observe badge count on app icon increments up by 1
6. Have User B mention you once in Off Topic, observe badge count increments up again by 1
7. Reply to the post from the notification (may slide the notification or pull it down, depending on OS)
8. Observe the badge number on the app icon

**Expected**

- Badge count on app icon is back down to 1 (incremented back down by one when you reply to one of the mentions but it does not clear both)
