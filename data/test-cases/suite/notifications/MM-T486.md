2. "test" user create a new channel and add "test.one" to it
3. "test.one" go to the new channel so that the mention badge received for being added to the channel disappears
4. "test" user go to Off-Topic channel
5. "test.one" leave the new channel you were added to by "test" user

**Expected**

- "test" user should not receive a mention when "test.one" leaves the channel
