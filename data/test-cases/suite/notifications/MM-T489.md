## MM-T489: Notification with Teammate Name Display set to Show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name

---

**Step 1**

Display teammate nickname when nickname exists\
\--------------------\
Push Notification Contents must be set to Send full message Snippet in System Console, such as rc.test.mattermost.com:\
\
1\. As the test user open Account Settings>> Display>> Teammate Name Display\
2\. Set the display to Show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name\
3\. Have another user who has a nickname post a mention for the test user in a group message channel with other users to send a notification

**Expected**

1\. Test user sees the notification\
2\. Notification header shows the name of the users in the GM by nickname\
3\. Sender's name is displayed as nickname\
4\. @mention in the message content shows the username of the test user\
\
Note: desktop notification not applicable to RN apps

**Step 2**

Display teammate first and last name when nickname does not exists\
\--------------------\
Push Notification Contents must be set to Send full message Snippet in System Console, such as rc.test.mattermost.com:\
\
1\. As the test user open Account Settings>> Display>> Teammate Name Display\
2\. Set the display to Show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name\
3\. Have another user who does not have a nickname post a mention for the test user in a group message channel with other users to send a notification

**Expected**

2\. Notification header shows the name of the users in the GM by first and last name (when the user has no nickname)\
3\. Sender's name is displayed as first and last name\
4\. @mention in the message content shows the username of the test user\
\
Note: desktop notification not applicable to RN apps
