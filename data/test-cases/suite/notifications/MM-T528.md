**Step 1**

Mobile 'in-app' (while app is open) notification increments the app icon count badge\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. On mobile app,
2.  Browse to Channel A
3.  Using another user, trigger "@all" notification in Channel B. Observe "in-app" notification displays.
4.  Put app in background. Observe badging on the app icon shows `1`
5.  Using another user, trigger a second "@all" notification in Channel B. Observe normal notification (but don't tap it).
6. With app still in background, observe badging.

_Important notes about this step:_

**Notes**:

- ANDROID needs to install another launcher such as Microsoft Launcher and change the notification settings to show number badge instead of just dot badge. Please ask QA for help on Android if needed. iOS is fine.
- Android needs third-party launcher such as Microsoft Launcher installed to show badge numbers (instead of just dots).

**Expected**

- Badge number on app icon has incremented up again by one, to show `2`
