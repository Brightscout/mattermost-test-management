### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Mobile Push Notifications - Fails to send reply from notification when not online<br>–––––––––––––––––––––––––<br><strong>Available on iOS and on Android 7.0 or newer</strong><ol><li>Have another user trigger a push notification for your RN app user</li><li> Put your device into airplane mode / turn off wifi so your device does not have a connection</li><li> Pull down push notification to reply</li><li> Try to send a reply from the push notification</li><li> Observe notification "Message failed to send"</li><li> Turn off airplane mode, in Mattermost view the message that triggered the notification</li><li>Verify the mention badge number on the menu icon appears correct (should no longer show the mention you just viewed as unread)</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article><ul><li>"Local push notification" is received saying "Message failed to send"</li><li>After reconnecting and viewing the message, mention badge count is accurate (if that was your only mention, should not be any mention count)</li></ul></article>
