## MM-T541: Mobile Push Notifications - Fails to send reply from notification when not online

---

**Step 1**

Mobile Push Notifications - Fails to send reply from notification when not online\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Available on iOS and on Android 7.0 or newer**

1. Have another user trigger a push notification for your RN app user
2. Put your device into airplane mode / turn off wifi so your device does not have a connection
3. Pull down push notification to reply
4. Try to send a reply from the push notification
5. Observe notification "Message failed to send"
6. Turn off airplane mode, in Mattermost view the message that triggered the notification
7. Verify the mention badge number on the menu icon appears correct (should no longer show the mention you just viewed as unread)

_Related ticket(s):_

[RN "Message failed to send" has confusing app badge behaviour — MM-14923](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14923)

**Expected**

- "Local push notification" is received saying "Message failed to send"
- After reconnecting and viewing the message, mention badge count is accurate (if that was your only mention, should not be any mention count)
