## MM-T1521: Files

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Files\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to the "files" channel
2. Check that the files imported properly

_Important notes about this step:_

This step is "N/A" on the original spreadsheet and may need to be deleted here.

**Expected**

- Files are imported properly (thumbnails look correct, clicking on them opens the previewer, downloading downloads the file).
- Comments on files are imported as posts in the channel.
