## MM-T1526: Messages

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Messages\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to the "messages" channel
2. Read through the posts

_Important notes about this step:_

This step is "N/A" on the original spreadsheet and may need to be deleted here.\
\
Slack "posts" are not imported, and should link to Slack for the file.\
\
except for the note in Expected as there are no files attached in LI's .zip

**Expected**

- The 4000 character post from Slack is posted properly (ends in "end").
- Compatible Slack formatting is rendered (note that some of Slack's markdown is not compatible with Mattermost). Added support for bold, strikethrough, and blockquotes in 3.7. Added channel "markdown" with posts to test formatting.
