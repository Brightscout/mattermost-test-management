## MM-T1525: Links

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

   - email link (ux\@mattermost.com)
   -  website autolinks
   -  youtube link
   -  png image link
   -  gif link
