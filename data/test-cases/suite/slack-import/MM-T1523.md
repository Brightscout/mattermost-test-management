## MM-T1523: Integrations

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Integrations\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to the "integrations" channel
2. Read through the webhook posts in the channel

_Important notes about this step:_

Link previews from import are currently not supported.

**Expected**

The posts in the channel should match the ones in the Slack channel.
