### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Setup a server where the integration limits are being enforced <br />2. Install and enable 4 non-core plugins that count towards the limit and enable them all<br />3. Install a 5th plugin that is not core and can be misconfigured (Zoom for example)<br />4. Enable the misconfigured plugin<br />5. Install an additional non-core plugin<br />6. Attempt to enable the plugin</article>

**Expected**

> <article>On 4. The plugin will crash due to missing configuration. <br />On 6. The server is already at the plugin limit even though a plugin is in a crashed state</article>
