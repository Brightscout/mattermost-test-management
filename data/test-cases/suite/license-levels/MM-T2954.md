## MM-T2954: No-license / TE change theme

---

**Step 1**

Example: Team edition should still be able to change theme, even though there exists on EE a config setting to disable theme selection. TE should be able to set theme by team (https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10478)\
\
Also test around enable/disable file upload and download on classic app, with and without license

**Expected**

Every setting should be set, regardless of whether there's a license present
