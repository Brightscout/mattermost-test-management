\--------------------\
Ensure you have a license on hand to re-upload after it is removed during this test

1. If not already EE, upload an EE license in System Console ➜ Edition and License
2. Go to System Console ➜ Permission Schemes ➜ System Scheme ➜ Edit Scheme
3. Under All Members ➜ Manage Public Channels, deselect "Create Channels"
4. Under All Members ➜ Manage Private Channels, deselect "Manage Channel Settings"
5. Under Team Administrators > Manage Private Channels, select "Manage Channel Settings"
6. Save and verify on a member and a team admin account that they're restricted as described ➜
7. (Ensure you have a license on hand to re-upload after this test. Links to test licences in header of https\://community-release.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/enterprise-edition). Remove the EE license in System Console > Edition and License and verify as described ➜

**Expected**

After #5,

- Verify that system admin sees option to create public channels and team admins / members do not
- Verify that team admin and system admin see option to rename private channel, and member does not

\
After #7,

- Permissions are frozen in place (same as above "After step 5"):

  - Verify that system admin sees option to create public channels and team admins / members do not
  - Verify that team admin and system admin see option to rename private channel, and member does not
