---

**Step 1**

Notification Settings Email - With setting set to Never\
\--------------------\
Note: Ensure Email Batching is "true" in the System Console > Notifications > Email Section\
\
Also ensure your status is set to Away or Offline (can set from drop-down in top left or use /away or /offline)\\

1. Open Settings > Notifications
2. Click "Edit" to the right of "Email Notifications"
3. Select "Never"
4. Click "Save"
5. Have another user send some mentions and DMs, then put the app/server in the background and don't touch it for at least 15 minutes :)
6. Check your email after 15 min

**Test Data**

Added to Se in v5.8 (Pass)

**Expected**

Email notifications are not sent.
