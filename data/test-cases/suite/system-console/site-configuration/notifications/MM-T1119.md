- If you deactivate a user's account

**Expected**

- UserB should receive an email confirming their email address was changed

1. As UserB, go to Profile > Profile Settings and change your username then check your email

**Expected**

- UserB should receive an email confirming their username was changed

---

1. As the system admin, go the User Management > Users and search for UserB
2. Click the dropdown to the right of UserB's name and select "Reset Password" and save
