### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Notification Settings<br />Email<br />Customized name, address, etc<br />--------------------<br />Set &quot;Notification Display Name:&quot; = Edited Mattermost<br />Set &quot;Notification From Address:&quot; = edited-feedback@mattermost.com (make sure whatever you edit it to is still in valid email address format; I added an extra `m` to the end once and it couldn't connect, but it wasn't obvious why)<br />Set &quot;Notification Footer Mailing Address:&quot; = &quot;Mattermost, 12345 test avenue, City, 90210&quot;<br />Save<br />Send an email notification by mentioning your account with another test account</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Email notification received is from the name and email address specified, and the email has the correct footer address.<br /><br /><br /><br />FYI defaults to re-set to:<br />Display Name: Feedback MM-postgres.test<br />From Address: feedback@mattermost.com<br />Mailing Address: {blank}</article>
