## MM-T1122: Notification Settings Mobile Push - GM (no mention), sender name only

---

**Step 1**

Notification Settings\
Mobile Push - GM (no mention), sender name only\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. On the receiving account go to ☰ menu ➜ Account Settings ➜ Notifications
2. Set push notifications to "For all activity"
3. As an Admin go to System Console ➜ Site Configuration ➜ Notifications
4. Set to "Generic description with only sender name"
5. System admin set to generic, sender only
6. Send a message with just a file attachment

**Expected**

- File-only message should say "\[other user] attached a file"

---

**Step 2**

1. Send a GM (without a mention in it)
2. After verifying, can set back to only send push notifications for mentions/DMs

**Expected**

- GM should say "\[other user] posted a message."
