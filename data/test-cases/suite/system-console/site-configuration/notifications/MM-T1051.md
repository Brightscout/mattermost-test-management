## MM-T1051: Max Notifications per Channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Set "Max Notifications per Channel" to "10", Save
2. Go to Town Square (where over 10 users)
3. Type "@channel" and post
4. Type "@all" and post (click through confirmation modal as needed)

**Expected**

- Message posts successfully but does not trigger notifications
- Ephemeral message displays "@channel \[@all] has been disabled because the channel has more than 10 users."
