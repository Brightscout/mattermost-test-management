Custom Support Email\
\--------------------\
1\. Change the "Support Email" to bot\@mattermost.com\
2\. Save\
3\. Switch back to a team, and replace "channels/town-square" with "/tutorial"\
(Note: that doesn't work anymore. Create new account)\
4\. Hit "Next" in the tutorial twice

**Expected**

Tutorial intro screen should display bot\@mattermost.com as the support email
