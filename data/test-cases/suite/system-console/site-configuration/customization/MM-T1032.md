## MM-T1032: Customization: Custom Terms and Privacy links in the About modal

---

**Step 1**

Customization\
Custom Terms and Privacy links in the About modal\
\--------------------\
All the links open to what was set in the System Console, except in About modal (updated v5.17)\
\
\*\* Check About modal (test below) before resetting links \*\*\
(Default settings are in the attached note; set them back after done testing)

Added check for formatting from MM-24856

**Test Data**

UPDATED 5.17\
MM-19759 (to default)\
\
UPDATED 5.10\
MM-13975 (About modal)

**Expected**

Links do not open to what was set in the System Console; they open to default pages\
\
In Main Menu > About the links are reading from the configuration in System Console > Customization.\
\
