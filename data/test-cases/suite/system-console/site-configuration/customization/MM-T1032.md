Custom Terms and Privacy links in the About modal\
\--------------------\
All the links open to what was set in the System Console, except in About modal (updated v5.17)\
\
\*\* Check About modal (test below) before resetting links \*\*\
(Default settings are in the attached note; set them back after done testing)

**Test Data**

UPDATED 5.17\
MM-19759 (to default)\
\
UPDATED 5.10\
MM-13975 (About modal)
