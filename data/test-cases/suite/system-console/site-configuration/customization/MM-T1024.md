## MM-T1024: Customization Custom Branding - Can change name and desc with custom branding set to false

---

**Step 1**

**Ensure `Enable Custom Branding` is set to `false`**

1. Change Site Name to "Mattermost\_Test" (or just add "-test" at the end)
2. Enter some text in the `Site Description` field, and Save
3. Log out (or view login page in a separate browser)

**Expected**

- Sign-in page should read "\[Team Name] on Mattermost\_Test"
- And the description text you entered should appear
