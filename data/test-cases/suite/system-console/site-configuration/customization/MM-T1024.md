## MM-T1024: Customization(newline)Custom Branding - Can change name and desc with custom branding set to false

---

**Step 1**

**Ensure \`Enable Custom Branding\` is set to \`false\`**

1. Change Site Name to "Mattermost\_Test" (or just add "-test" at the end)
2. Enter some text in the \`Site Description\` field, and Save
3. Log out (or view login page in a separate browser)

**Expected**

- Sign-in page should read "\[Team Name] on Mattermost\_Test"
- And the description text you entered should appear
