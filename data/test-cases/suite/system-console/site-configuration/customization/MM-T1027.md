## MM-T1027: Custom branding is enabled but no image has been uploaded

---

**Step 1**

Custom branding is enabled but no image has been uploaded\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in as system admin on a server that does not already have an image uploaded for custom branding\
2\. Go to System Console > Customization > Custom Branding\
3\. Set Enable Custom Branding to `true` but do not upload a brand image, Save\
4\. Log out (or view login page as another user)

**Expected**

No broken image appears; the part of the page where an uploaded image would appear if there were one should just appear blank
