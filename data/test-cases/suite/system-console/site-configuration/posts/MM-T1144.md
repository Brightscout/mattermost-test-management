## MM-T1144: Enable Latex Rendering

---

**Step 1**

Enable Latex Rendering\
\--------------------

1. Set to True and post the following:\
   \
   \`\`\` latex\
   \frac{d}{dx}\left( \int\_{0}^{x} f(u)\\,du\right)=f(x).\
   \`\`\`

   1. Observe post renders in LaTeX

2. Set to False and observe previously posted Latex

   1. Previous post is rendered as plain text

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- Post is rendered as Latex
- Post is left-aligned like other post text

---

**Step 2**

Inline Latex Rendering\
\-----------------

1. Set to true System Console>Site Configuration>Posts>Enable Inline Latex RenderingÂ 

2. Post some inline latex\
   Latex text should be added in between $ signs\
   See Sample text data-->

   1. Verify inline latex renders as expected (see image in test data)

**Test Data**

Sample Test Text:\
a couple of equations in 1 message: $6^2 - 5 = 36-5 = 31$, another one: $L' = {L}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$. Maxwell: $E'=\nabla \times B - 4\pi j$. A hard equation: $\lim\_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x-1}{2x}} \overset{\left\[\frac{0}{0}\right]}{\underset{\mathrm{H}}{=}} \lim\_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x}{2}}={\frac{1}{2}}$. Some weird symbols: $y = a + f(\underbrace{b x}\_{\ge 0 \text{ by assumption}}) = a + f(\underbrace{b x}\_{\mathclap{\ge 0 \text{ by assumption}}})$. Verry long arrows: $A \xleftarrow{\text{this way}} B \xrightarrow\[\text{or that way}]{ } C$. Sample integral: $b\_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits\_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\sin nx\\,\mathrm{d}x=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits\_{-\pi}^{\pi}x^2\sin nx\\,\mathrm{d}x$\
\
_Post should render as below_\

**Expected**

Inline latex renders as expected

---

**Step 3**

Inline Latex Rendering\
\-----------------

1. With Inline Latex enabled verify $ signs are not triggering latex when used as dollar amounts and in other text or links\
   Post the following:\
   \
   some text with 15$ and 20$\
   some text with $15 and $20\
   some text with 15$ and $20\
   some text with $20 and 20$\
   \`\
   \[$1+2=3$]\(https\://example.com)\
   \_$1+2=3$\_\
   \*\*$1+2=3$\*\*\
   \~\~$1+2=3$\~\~\
   https\://example.com/$/test/$foo\
   \`\`\`\
   $1+2=3$\
   \`\`\`\
   \`$1+2=3$\`\
   \
   \
   Note:\
   some text with $20 and 20$\
   ^this will trigger latex, but it is an edge case where 2 different styles of dollar values are mixed, acceptable at this time\
   Code block and inline code should be respected

**Expected**

Inline latex is rendering only when the first $ sign is not preceded by the word character (letter, number or underscore) and when the last $ sign is also not followed by the word character.\
e.g. $latex code between dollar signs$
