## MM-T1067: Teammate Name Display: at-mention in message draft

---

**Step 1**

Teammate Name Display: at-mention in message draft\
\--------------------\
Test with each different setting (included in Se tests)\
\
1\. Type @ and the beginning of a user's Se-IDEntifier (nickname, first/last, etc.) in message (or reply) box\
2\. Click autocomplete suggestion for the user you want to mention

**Expected**

In message draft, autocomplete resolves to `@username`, regardless of teammate name display setting
