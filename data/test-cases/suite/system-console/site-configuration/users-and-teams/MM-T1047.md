---

**Step 1**

Max Users per Team\
\--------------------\

2\. Have a user not on the team try to join the team using Join Another Team

**Expected**

Error page shows\
\
Note for PMs, the way the error flow for this page works now is that it'll display the error message as it does from a signup link. If the user presses the "< Back" link, it'll bring them back to the team list. If they press the browser's back button, it'll send them back to the chat view.
