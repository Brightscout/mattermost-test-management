### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Max Users per Team<br />--------------------<br />1. Set Max Users to number of users on the current team, Save<br />2. Have a user not on the team try to join the team using Join Another Team</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Error page shows<br /><br />Note for PMs, the way the error flow for this page works now is that it'll display the error message as it does from a signup link. If the user presses the &quot;&lt; Back&quot; link, it'll bring them back to the team list. If they press the browser's back button, it'll send them back to the chat view.</article>
