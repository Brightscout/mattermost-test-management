### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Restrict users to open Direct Message channels with users they share a team with - Channel Switcher<br>--------------------<br>Note: Ensure there are multiple teams, and you can identify two users on the server who are on different teams; not on any same team together (or create a new user on one team, and Se-IDEntify a user who isn't on that team but is on the same server)<br><br>1. In System Console &gt; Users and Teams, set "Enable users to open Direct Message channels" to "Any member of the team"<br>2. As one of the non-system admins, observe a user on the server who is NOT on your team<br>3. Log out as admin and log in as one of the users you identified<br>4. Open channel switcher using CTRL/CMD+K<br>5. Type the first few characters of the other user's name </article>

**Expected**

> <article>User1 who is not on any team with user2 should not see user2 appear on the user list after step 5.</article>
