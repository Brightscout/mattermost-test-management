## MM-T1054: Restrict users to open Direct Message channels with users they share a team with - Channel Switcher

---

**Step 1**

Restrict users to open Direct Message channels with users they share a team with - Channel Switcher\
\--------------------\
Note: Ensure there are multiple teams, and you can identify two users on the server who are on different teams; not on any same team together (or create a new user on one team, and Se-IDEntify a user who isn't on that team but is on the same server)\
\
1\. In System Console > Users and Teams, set "Enable users to open Direct Message channels" to "Any member of the team"\
2\. As one of the non-system admins, observe a user on the server who is NOT on your team\
3\. Log out as admin and log in as one of the users you identified\
4\. Open channel switcher using CTRL/CMD+K\
5\. Type the first few characters of the other user's name

**Expected**

User1 who is not on any team with user2 should not see user2 appear on the user list after step 5.
