## MM-T1049: Max Channels per Team: Can't create over max, including archived

---

**Step 1**

Max Channels per Team\
\--------------------\
1\. "Max Channels Per Team" to 5\
2\. Save\
3\. Try creating more than 5 channels in at least two teams (you can use the function \`/test channels 10\` to create 10 channels

**Expected**

Only 5 channels can be created in any team. (Note: This includes deleted channels.)\
\
On trying to save a new public channel, error displays "Cannot create more than 5 channels for current team"\
\
\\/ Selenium also tests deleting a channel and verifying still over limit

---

**Step 2**

1\. Archive a channel so "active" channels are one below max channels per team\
2\. Click + to create a new private channel, enter channel info, save

**Expected**

On trying to save a new private channel, error displays "Cannot create more than 5 channels for current team" (archived channel still counts toward max channels)
