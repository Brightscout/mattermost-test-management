### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Max Channels per Team<br>--------------------<br>1. "Max Channels Per Team" to 5<br>2. Save<br>3. Try creating more than 5 channels in at least two teams (you can use the function `/test channels 10` to create 10 channels</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Only 5 channels can be created in any team. (Note: This includes deleted channels.)<br><br>On trying to save a new public channel, error displays "Cannot create more than 5 channels for current team"<br><br>\/ Selenium also tests deleting a channel and verifying still over limit</article>

<hr/>

**Step 2**

> <article>1. Archive a channel so "active" channels are one below max channels per team<br>2. Click + to create a new private channel, enter channel info, save</article>

**Expected**

> <article>On trying to save a new private channel, error displays "Cannot create more than 5 channels for current team" (archived channel still counts toward max channels)</article>
