### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Teammate Name Display: Set up users for tests<br />--------------------<br />Setup: Have five other users on a team set up as follows. As you log in to each user's account to change their settings, post a message from that account.<br />a. Username only<br />b. First and last name set (no nickname)<br />c. Nickname (no first or last name)<br />d. First name only (no last name or nickname)<br />e. First and last and nickname</article>

**Expected**

> <article>Confirmed (and fixed) in v5.4: Any change to Account Settings overrides (and continues to override) System Console setting.<br /><br />So the Se test has been adjusted 10/9/18 5.5 release testing to:<br />1. Verify each System Console setting behaves as expected, BEFORE the user who is viewing makes any changes to their Account Settings setting<br />2. Verify when the user changes Account Settings setting, that setting is honored (and the System Console settings is overriden)<br />3. Verify if System Console changes after user changed their setting, the user sees no change<br />4. Verify (just for fun) that if the user changes their setting to match System Console, all display as expected<br /><br />Update test steps listed here in spreadsheet to reflect the changes</article>
