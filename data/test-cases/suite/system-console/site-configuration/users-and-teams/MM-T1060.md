## MM-T1060: Teammate Name: Profile Settings overrides System Console (user changes Profile Settings _after_ set in System Console)

---

**Step 1**

Teammate Name:\
Profile Settings overrides System Console (user changes Profile Settings \*after\* set in System Console)\
\--------------------\
1\. Set Teammate Name Display to something other than "show username default"\
2\. Create a new user\
3\. Ensure users' profile setting match value set in 1.\
4\. As the user created in 2. change the profile setting to a different value\
5\. As the sysadmin change Teammate Name Display to the 3rd value (does not match current system console or new users' value)\
6\. As the user crested in 2., ensure the Teammate Name Display was not modified by the actions of step 5. (logout and login again to be safe)

**Test Data**

ADDED TO SE TEST BEFORE 5.4https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-7898 DH: I added steps based on my understanding (might need peer review and polish)

**Expected**

In all cases, the Profile Settings value for Teammate Name Display is being respected and is only updated when changed by the end user.\
Check this for the following:\
\- After step 3.\
\- After step 4.\
\- After step 5.\
\- After step 6.
