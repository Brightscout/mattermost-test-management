## MM-T1070: Privacy Email Address - Hidden Other user changes email address System admin should still see

---

**Step 1**

Privacy\
Email Address - Hidden\
Other user changes email address\
System admin should still see\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Set "Show Email Address" = false in Site Configuration ➜ Users and Teams
2. Have another user post a message from another browser
3. Have System Admin click the other user's profile pic and verify can see email address of other user in profile popover
4. Back to other browser, have other user edit their email address
5. If necessary, other user should verify their email address to make the change go through
6. Back to System admin, have them click the profile pic of that user again (or just keep it open; no refresh or anything is required)

_Important notes about this step:_

Test has to be manual, in multiple browsers: Logging other user out and then the admin in, resets and doesn't repro the issue that prompted this test case

**Expected**

- System admin can still see other user's email address, updated
