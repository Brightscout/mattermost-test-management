### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Restrict users to open Direct Message channels with users they share a team with - More...<br>--------------------<br>Note: Ensure there are multiple teams, and you can identify two users on the server who are on different teams; not on any same team together (or create a new user on one team, and Se-IDEntify a user who isn't on that team but is on the same server)<br><br>1. In System Console &gt; Users and Teams, set "Enable users to open Direct Message channels" to "Any member of the team"<br>2. Identify a pair of users on the server who are not on any team together<br>3. Log out as admin and log in as one of the users you identified<br>4. In the LHS, click the top `+` to find a new channel, then click Open a New Direct Message (old sidebar was: Direct Messages &gt; More)<br>5. View the user list (can type the beginning of the other user's name to narrow it down)<br><br></article>

**Expected**

> <article>​​​​User1 who is not on any team with user2 should not see user2 appear on the DM list.<br><br>(Selenium: Use test3 and test8)</article>
