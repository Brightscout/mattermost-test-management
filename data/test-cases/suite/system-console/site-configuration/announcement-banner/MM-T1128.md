## MM-T1128: Announcement Banner - Dismissible banner shows long text truncated

---

**Step 1**

Announcement Banner - Dismissible banner shows long text on multiple lines\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Change banner text to the following:
   \
   \
   Here's an announcement! It has a link: http\://example.com. It's a really long announcement, because we have a lot to say. Be sure to read it all, click the link, then dismiss the banner, and then you can go on to the next test, which will have a shorter announcement. Thank you for reading and have a nice day!
2. Change the banner and text colors (leave dismissal set to true)
3. Save

**Expected**

- Text displays truncated, and can be viewed in full on hover
- Colors match updated settings
- URL is a live link
- Dismiss banner
