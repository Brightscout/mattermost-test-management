## MM-T953: Verify Correct Authentication Method is shown for Email, SAML, LDAP, MFA users

---

**Step 1**

**Test this on https\://mattermost-cloud-release-testing.test.mattermost.cloud/ where OAuth should already be set up**

1. Search for a User whose sign in method is as follows and click on the user in User Management ➜ Users page and verify the Authentication Method shown in Users page:

   1. Email
   2. SAML
   3. LDAP

2. Enable MFA and configure MFA for a user. Then in the system console, search for that user in the User Management ➜ Users page and verify if the MFA is displayed in Users page. 

**Expected**

- The Authentication method should be displayed correctly in User page.\
  It should be displayed as Email, SAML and LDAP respectively.
- For a user who has MFA configured, the text "MFA" should be displayed after the first authentication method, like:\
  "Email, MFA"
