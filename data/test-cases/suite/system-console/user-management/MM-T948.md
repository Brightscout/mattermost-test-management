## MM-T948: DM posts searchable in DM More... and channel switcher(newline)DM channel re-openable

---

**Step 1**

For now, writing test to reflect that DM did not auto-close when user was deactivated

1. Close the DM with deactivated user
2. CTRL/CMD+K or click button to open channel switcher, observe as described
3. Close channel switcher, click DM More...
4. Observe as described, then click the deactivated user

**Expected**

- In both channel switcher and DM More... list:

  - Deactivated user is ordered at bottom of list
  - No status indicator
  - " - Deactivated" appears after user's name

- After selecting deactivated user, DM More... closes so no further users can be selected, and DM channel opens
