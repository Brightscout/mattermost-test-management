### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article><strong>As system admin</strong>:<ol><li>On desktop app or browser: Open a GM channel with 3 users</li><li>Observe the channel name in the LHS and note which user is listed first (alpha order)</li><li>Also open a DM with that first-listed user, and post a message that includes a word you'll be able to search on easily (to verify included in search results)</li><li>Open a separate browser (still as that system admin), open System Console ➜ Users, deactivate that first-listed user you sent the DM to</li><li>In first browser/desktop app, view channel list in LHS, verify as described &nbsp;➜</li><li>Search for the word you know will return the DM, verify as described ➜</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

> <article>After 5,<ul><li>Deactivated user's name continues to display as part of the GM channel name</li><li>Channel names do not change their alphabetical positions in LHS</li><li>DM with that user has an archive icon instead of the user icon in the LHS (if there was no refresh; if refreshed or navigated away and back, the deactivated user's DM may be removed from the LHS)</li></ul><br>After 6,<ul><li>The post in the DM with the deactivated user is still returned in search results</li><li><strong>Related bug (Won't Fix)</strong>: <a href="https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10115" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LHS Displayed Name for Group Message is not the first username alphabetically — MM-10115</a></li></ul></article>
