## MM-T942: Users - Deactivated user not in drop-down, auto-logged out

---

**Step 1**

1. Using drop-down menu to the right of the user's name, click to Deactivate and confirm
2. In a channel where the deactivated user had been a member, click the member icon

**Expected**

On 1,

- User is made inactive (logs user out automatically; try to log back in to confirm deactivated: "_Login failed because your account has been deactivated. Please contact an administrator._")
- Deactivated user does not show up in View Members for channels or teams (but does show up in DM More... menu so that DM channels can be viewed)

\
On 2, Deactivated user is not listed in the member list
