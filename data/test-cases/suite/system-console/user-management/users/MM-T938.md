## MM-T938: Users - Revoke a user's sessions

---

**Step 1**

1. Log on as another test user (who you want to revoke sessions for), on multiple browsers / devices (at least 2 to 3 different sessions)\
   **Examples**: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android (RN or Classic); various browsers; desktop app

   - Mobile apps can have screen locked or not
   - Non-mobile can be with computer awake or asleep
   - Can log them in using any method (email/password, SAML, LDAP, OAuth)
   - Keep them visible, to watch for sessions ending

2. Logged in as system admin on another browser / device, go to System Console ➜ Users

3. Find the other user you've logged in with multiple sessions ➜ user drop-down ➜ Revoke Sessions

**Expected**

**Other users' sessions are all revoked; user is redirected to login page, either**:

- When the user tries to switch channels or otherwise interact with the app, or
- Automatically after a period of \~2-30 seconds without the user touching the app
- Other user can successfully log back in (test on at least one)
