## MM-T943: Users - Deactivate a user - DM, GM in LHS (not actively viewing DM in another window)

---

**Step 1**

1. Open a DM with a user you want to deactivate, post a message
2. Also open a GM with that user and a third user, post a message
3. Observe DM and GM in LHS
4. System Console > Users
5. Find the user you want to deactivate > user drop-down > Deactivate, confirm
6. Go back to view team

**Expected**

- **DM**: On returning to the team the DM has been removed from LHS
- **GM** stays in LHS channel list
- **GM** still has message box (is not archived)
