---

**Step 1**

1. Locate user whose password you want to change and who is logged in in a different browser
2. Using drop-down menu to the right of the user's name, click to update their password, enter the new password, and click to save (modal should close)
3. Log other user out and try to log in with old password
4. Log other user in using new password

**Expected**

After step 2: Log out other user, old pwd doesn't work, new one does
