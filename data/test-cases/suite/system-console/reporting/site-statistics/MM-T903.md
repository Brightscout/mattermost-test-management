## MM-T903: Site Statistics > Deactivating a user increments the Daily and Monthly Active Users counts down

---

**Step 1**

As system admin on a server that has active users (and at least one user you can deactivate), view System Console âžœ Site Statistics\
Make note of the following values:

1. Total Active Users
2. Daily Active Users
3. Monthly Active Users
4. Go to Users and deactivate a user (user should have been active today and this month in order for "Daily" and "Monthly" active users to increment down)
5. Go back to Site Statistics

**Expected**

- After 3) All three counts increment down
