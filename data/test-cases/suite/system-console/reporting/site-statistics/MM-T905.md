## MM-T905: Site Statistics card labels in different languages

---

**Step 1**

1. Change Account Settings ➜ Display ➜ Language to Français
2. View System Console ➜ Site Statistics (the first page)

**Expected**

- In _most _cases, titles in the "cards" (boxes across the top) should fit without being truncated. 

- The following titles will truncate as they are just too long to be displayed:

  - Nombre total de comma...
  - Connexions bases de do...
  - Connexions bases de do...
