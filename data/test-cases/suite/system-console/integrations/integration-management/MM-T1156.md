## MM-T1156: Access Tokens - Delete own token

---

**Step 1**

Access Tokens - Delete own token\
\--------------------\
Back in Account Settings, click to Delete that token (then click Yes, Delete)\
Check that user in System Console > Users > Manage Tokens, verify the disabled token is no longer listed (refresh if needed)

**Expected**

Delete removes the token from modal and also from system admin's view in System Console > Users > Manage tokens for that user (may need to refresh system console to see the change)
