## MM-T3311: Check Compliance Jobs rerun after warning status

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create a post with an attachment.\
2\. Go to the Data Directory and delete the attachment.\
3\. Run an export that supports warnings. (CSV, Actiance)\
4\. Report should run with X messages exported and X warnings.\
5\. Rerun report\
6\. Report should indicate 0 messages exported.

**Expected**

Compliance Export should not start the export again and display the same message "X messages exported and X warnings" twice. Instead next time the export is executed, it should display "0 messages exported"
