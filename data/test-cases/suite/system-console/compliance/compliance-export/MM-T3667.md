## MM-T3667: Download Compliance Export File - Only User with permission should download compliance export

---

**Step 1**

1\. Ensure the DownloadExportResults config is set to true in config.json and restart the server. \
2\. Login as System Admin and trigger a compliance export for CSV and ensure some messages are exported. \
3\. Now login as System Manager and notice that there is no option to view Compliance Exports. \
4\. Now trigger the following API:\
/api/v4/jobs/type/message\_export?page=0\&per\_page=50\
5\. This will return the ID of the exported file which can be downloaded. \
6\. Now access the following API from the browser:\
/api/v4/jobs/\<JOB\_ID>/download

**Expected**

System User should not be able to download and following Json message should show up,

```
"message":"You do not have the appropriate permissions."
```
