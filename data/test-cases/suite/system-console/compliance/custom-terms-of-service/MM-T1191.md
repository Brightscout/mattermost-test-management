## MM-T1191: Custom Terms of Service - Repeated edits must be agreed to

---

**Step 1**

Custom Terms of Service - Repeated edits must be agreed to\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In an incognito browser window, log in as that ordinary user (UserA) and view ToS
2. In a normal browser window, log in as a system admin (UserB)
3. As UserB, go to System Console ➜ Compliance ➜ Custom Terms of Service (Beta)
4. Edit the text in the "Custom Terms of Service Text" box
5. Click "Save"
6. At this point, both users are seeing the TOS page (system admin is still in System Console)
7. Admin (UserB) clicks I Agree button
8. UserB then updates the text again
9. Ordinary user, UserA, click on "I Agree" on Terms of Service page you are viewing (with the original text)
10. UserA then sees the updated TOS from step 8
11. UserA, click on "I Agree" again

**Expected**

- After agreeing to the original TOS and ALSO the updated TOS, UserA is directed to the team
- If a user is viewing the ToS while they are being updated by the sysadmin, the user will be presented with an updated copy after clicking "I Agree" the first time and will have to click "I Agree" again before proceeding to the team.
