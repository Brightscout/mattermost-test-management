### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>1. Start with a new Mattermost installation.<br>2. On starting the server each time, all system admins will receive a message from the Admin Advisor bot asking them to configure the Support Email admin console setting.<br>3. Go to System Console &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Customization and notice that the support email's default value is empty, compared to the old default value of "feedback@mattermost.com".<br>4. Go to channel.<br>5. As long as this field remains empty, all system admins will receive the message from Admin Advisor each time the server is started, and once a week when the admin advisor job runs.<br>6. Configuring the Support Email value in System Console will stop these messages from Admin Advisor.</article>

**Expected**

> <article>3. Support email should be empty.<br>4. BOT notification should be shown in channel.<br><br></article>
