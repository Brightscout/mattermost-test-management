## MM-T4032: Prompt admins to change the Support Email

---

**Step 1**

1\. Start with a new Mattermost installation.\
2\. On starting the server each time, all system admins will receive a message from the Admin Advisor bot asking them to configure the Support Email admin console setting.\
3\. Go to System Console > Site Configuration > Customization and notice that the support email's default value is empty, compared to the old default value of "feedback\@mattermost.com".\
4\. Go to channel.\
5\. As long as this field remains empty, all system admins will receive the message from Admin Advisor each time the server is started, and once a week when the admin advisor job runs.\
6\. Configuring the Support Email value in System Console will stop these messages from Admin Advisor.

**Expected**

3\. Support email should be empty.\
4\. BOT notification should be shown in channel.
