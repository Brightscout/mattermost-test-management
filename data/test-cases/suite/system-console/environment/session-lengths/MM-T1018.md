> <article>Session lengths - Idle timeout<br>–––––––––––––––––––––––––<ol><li>Set idle timeout to 5 minutes and save</li><li>Log another user in to the server on another browser and start a timer</li><li>Leave that browser untouched until at least 5+ minutes</li></ol></article>

**Expected**

Please log in again.")</li><li>Set back to 0 (unlimited) after test is done (or whatever it had been set to before. postgres.test is often set to 1440 but could make it 14400)</li></ul></article>
