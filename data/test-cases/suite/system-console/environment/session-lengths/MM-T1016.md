## MM-T1016: Sessions lengths - Mobile

---

**Step 1**

Sessions lengths - Mobile\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
Might want to spin up a bot-server for this one, since it requires keeping the setting at \`1\` for over 24 hours

1. Log out of any MOBILE sessions if there are any, via Account Settings ➜ Security ➜ View and Logout of Active Sessions
2. Set "Session length for mobile apps (days):" to 1 in System Console
3. Save
4. Log in to the server on BOTH an Android and an iOS device (if don't have both, can ask if someone else can log in on their device and leave it on that server for a day)
5. Stay logged in on that device for >1 day

**Expected**

- Session expiry notification received on both Android and iOS
