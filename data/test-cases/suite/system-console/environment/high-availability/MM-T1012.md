## MM-T1012: High Availability - DO NOT SAVE this setting

---

**Step 1**

High Availability - DO NOT SAVE this setting\
\--------------------\
1\. Set to `true` (DO NOT SAVE; it makes System Console read-only unless read-only is disabled)\
2\. Verify info appears at top as described, then CANCEL or navigate away and DISCARD changes

**Expected**

Cluster status table appears at the top\
\
Text appears in a box, with long warning message (starts with "WARNING: These settings may not sync with the other servers in the cluster...."
