## MM-T989: Subpath - Second subpath: User on other subpath (but not on this one) is not visible in DM More... list

---

**Step 1**

Subpath - Second subpath: User on other subpath (but not on this one) is not visible in DM More... list\
\--------------------\
1\. Identify user who is on /mattermost but not on /mattermost2\
2\. Log in on /mattermost2\
3\. DM > More... type the name of that user

**Test Data**

ADDED v5.13\
(LM - came to mind)

**Expected**

User not on that second subpath does not appear in DM More... list\
\
((Could add further second subpath tests as well if we want))
