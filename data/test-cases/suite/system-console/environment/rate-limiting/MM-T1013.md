---

**Step 1**

Rate Limiting settings UI\
\--------------------\
1\. Set "Enable Rate Limiting" = false (or to true if already false)

**Expected**

All Rate limit settings should grey out and become uneditable when false, and be editable when true\
\
Can change settings, save, refresh, settings persist
