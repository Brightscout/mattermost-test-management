## MM-T5379: Should match title and custom description in root html

---

**Step 1**

1. Start a server with default config both for site name (`TeamSettings.SiteName`) and custom description text (`TeamSettings.CustomDescriptionText`). Then go to login page (`<site_url>/login`) page.
2. Login as admin and change site name and custom description at `<site_url>/admin_console/site_config/customization`, save and log out, then go to login page.

**Expected**

After step 1, verify the following,

- the header on top left is shown with Mattermost logo, and the login card renders "Log in".
- the `head` tag contains "Mattermost" as `title` and no `meta` for `og:description`.After step 2, verify the following,
- the header on top left is shown with custom title and without Mattermost logo, and the login card renders custom description.
- Verify that the `head` tag contains custom title as `title` and `meta` for `og:description` is present with custom description as its `content`.
