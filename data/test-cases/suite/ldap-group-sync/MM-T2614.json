He should have been removed from any groups though (wouldn't be visible in the groups list of users and newly associated channels wouldn't add him to the channel).<br /><br />Perhaps those last 2 things could be part of your test (either now or in future):<br />Not listed as user in group<br />Newly associated channel, say, doesn't add him to the channel upon the next sync",
