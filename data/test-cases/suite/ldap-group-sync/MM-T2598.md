## MM-T2598: Admin adds two teams at once in the team linking selection modal

---

**Step 1**

Admin adds two teams at once in the team linking selection modal\
————————————————————————————\
Created 2 new teams, added them to abc links at the same time, synced\
carlos.test got 2 new teams as expected

**Expected**

Same behavior as linking one; new user is added to both teams, existing user isn't added until after sync
