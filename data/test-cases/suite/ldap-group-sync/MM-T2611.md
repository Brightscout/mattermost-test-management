george.test xyz dev team and 2 private channels (standup and xyz), eng team with default channels\
corey.test eng eng team with default channels\
lindy.test qa group qa team and private channel, eng team with default channels\
\
MK in AD deactivates linda.test, george.test, and corey.test\
User filter to filter out deactivated users (such as (&(objectClass=person)(!(cn=Test.\*))(!(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))\
), then LDAP sync\
\

LDAP sync (leaving in the filter that filters out deactivated users)\
\
