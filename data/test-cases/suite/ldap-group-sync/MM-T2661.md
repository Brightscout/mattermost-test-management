## MM-T2661: Exclude deleted user from group count

---

**Step 1**

Exclude deleted user from group count\
————————————————————————————

1. Create a group with 2+ users.
2. Delete the user in the database by UPDATE Users SET DeleteAt = 1 WHERE Id = 'some-user-id';
3. Load the groups details view in the admin console, observe the member count is wrong.
4. Load a channel and/or team details view in the admin console, observe the member count is wrong there too.

**Expected**

- Count member count should be correct in all of them, decrementing correctly the count because of the user that was deleted
