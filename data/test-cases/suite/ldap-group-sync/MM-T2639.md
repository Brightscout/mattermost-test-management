## MM-T2639: Policy settings (in System Console tests, likely)

---

**Step 1**

Policy settings (in System Console tests, likely)\
\
User who has permission to add/manage members in public but not private can do so before conversion but not after (including seeing the link to add users that appears at the beginning of the channel)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. While channel is still public, verify non-system admin can add members
2. Before converting, system admin sets policy to restrict private channel member management to system admins

**Expected**

- After converting, non-system admin cannot see options to manage / add members for private channel
