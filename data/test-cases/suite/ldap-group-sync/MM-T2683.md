**Step 1**

Chat Facing ➜ Team ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Team Members\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Team, login as a user User1 who has Team Admin permissions.
2. For the same group synced team, on a different browser, login as a user User2 who has Team Admin permissions.
3. As User1, Click on Manage Groups from Main menu and then set the role to Team Members for a Group which User2 belongs to.
4. User2 should immediately be updated to Team Member role and should not be able to perform Team Admin tasks like view and modify Team Settings, Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User2 still has Team Member permission for that Team.

**Expected**

- User2 should be updated to a Team Member role and should not be able to perform any Team Admin Tasks
