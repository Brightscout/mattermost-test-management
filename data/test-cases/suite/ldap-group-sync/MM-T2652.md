**Step 1**

Team: Removal warning for users with different auth types and group memberships, groups are listed (similar to above channel test)\
————————————————————————————

1. User1 in 3 groups, joins TeamA
2. User2 in 2 groups, joins TeamA
3. User3 in 1 group, joins TeamA
4. Users 4 through 20 not in any group (include email/password users, other SSO users), join TeamA
5. TeamA links to a group that none of the above are in
6. Sync LDAP
7. Team management for that team, enable sync (constraint)
8. Observe warning at bottom, click link to view list of users who will be removed, hover to see groups users 1 through 3 belong to
9. Click Save
10. Observe warning modal listing numbers etc of users who will be removed after sync
11. Click to confirm, sync LDAP
