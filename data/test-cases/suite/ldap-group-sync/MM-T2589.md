## MM-T2589: No groups are linked; user joins for first time (using LDAP) and is not added to any team

---

**Step 1**

No groups are linked; user joins for first time (using LDAP) and is not added to any team\
————————————————————————————\
Admin does not link any teams/channels to any group (but LDAP is connected and LDAP groups are visible in Mattermost on the Groups page)\
New user corey.test logs in for the first time using SAML credentials using LDAP\
Admin syncs LDAP

**Expected**

User is not added to any team/channel\
User can join a team on team selection page if available (or create a new team, depending on permissions)
