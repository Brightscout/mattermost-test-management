## MM-T2677: Demote Team Role Permission

---

**Step 1**

Demote Team Role Permission\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Team, select a Group and set the Role to Team Admin in System Console ➜ Teams page.
2. Run LDAP Group Sync job and check if user has access to the Team with Team Admin permission.
3. Change the role from Team Admin to Members for the same team in System Console ➜ Teams page.
4. User should immediately be updated to Team Member role and should not be able to perform Team Admin tasks like view and modify Team Settings, Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User still has Team Member permission for that Team.
