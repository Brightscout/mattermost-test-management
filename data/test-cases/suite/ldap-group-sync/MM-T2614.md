### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>COULD ADD for SAML-sync enabled:<br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />Filtering out user with SAML sync on should remove the user from LDAP group and any future changes, but they can still log in using SAML:<br />To me that is expected because SAML is the source of authenticating that user and because there's no &quot;force remove&quot; feature enabled yet in phase 1.<br /><br />So he's able to login and also hasn't been removed from any channels or teams. He should have been removed from any groups though (wouldn't be visible in the groups list of users and newly associated channels wouldn't add him to the channel).<br /><br />Perhaps those last 2 things could be part of your test (either now or in future):<br />Not listed as user in group<br />Newly associated channel, say, doesn't add him to the channel upon the next sync</article>

**Expected**

> <article>v5.10 testing, quite convoluted, but I ended up with something like this: Filtered out carlos.test with (!(uid=carlos.test)), synced, sync message shows 1 deactivated user. carlos.test cannot log in using LDAP. <br /><br />Enabled SAML-LDAP sync, synced LDAP. carlos.test@simulator.amazonses.com can log in using SAML, but when filtered out, carlos.test is auto-logged out and deactivated (just like with SAML user not in LDAP)<br /><br />One time trying to log in with user filter in place (I think first time maybe?): Error: error retrieving groups for user<br /><br />Remove filter and carlos.test gets groups and all from the LDAP group sync</article>
