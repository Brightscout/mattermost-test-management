2. Login as Sysadmin on a new browser and run the LDAP Group Sync job.
3. The bot accounts should not be removed from the LDAP Group Synced Team and Channel.
4. Go to Teams page and search for the team. Change the Role dropdown to a different value and check if the bot account should not be removed from the team.
