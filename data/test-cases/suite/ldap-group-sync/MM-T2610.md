## MM-T2610: Admin filters users

---

**Step 1**

Admin filters users\
————————————————————————————

1. User is in a linked LDAP group (so their name is listed in the groups details view).
2.  User filter is changed to filter-out user from Mattermost:\
   LDAP:\
   (!(uid=carlos.test))\
   \
   AD:\
   (&(objectClass=person)(!(cn=Test.\*))(!(sAMAccountName=carlos.test)))
3. Sync\
   \
   Set filter back to:\
   LDAP:\
   (&(objectClass=person)(!(cn=Test.\*)))\
   AD\
   (&(objectClass=person)(!(cn=Test.\*)))

**Expected**

- User should no longer appear in user list in groups details view
- Filtered-out user cannot log in
