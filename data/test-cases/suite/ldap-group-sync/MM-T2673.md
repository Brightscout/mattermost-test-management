**Step 1**

Group Roles on New User login\
————————————————————————————

1. Set a different role for a group for a team/channel
2. Do not perform a LDAP Group Sync
3. Login as a new user.
4. Check if new user is assigned the permissions according to the permissions set in System Configuration ➜ Groups page

- New user should be assigned the Team & Channel permissions based on the roles defined in the System Console for that team and Channel
