### Steps

<hr/>

**Step 1**

> <article>Admin filters groups<br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />Enable LDAP signin and disable SAML sync w/LDAP, then continue:<br />Log in carlos.test using LDAP, observe he gets dev and eng teams<br />Add or adjust LDAP Group Filter on LDAP page to filter out ABC group:<br />(&amp;(objectClass=groupOfNames)(!(cn=Test Group *))(!(cn=abc)))<br />Filtered-out group abc does not appear in list on Groups page<br />Admin syncs LDAP<br />Log in jesse.test for the first time, observe [he gets no teams? he gets engineering team? Asking MK because current behavior is different from what I noted in previous testing]<br /><br /><br />Team and channel is linked to a group<br />Admin syncs LDAP<br />Verify user in that group is in that team/channel<br />Admin adds or adjusts LDAP Group Filter (on LDAP page) to filter OUT QA group:<br />(|(cn=engineering)(cn=developers)(cn=abc)(cn=xyz))<br />or<br />(&amp;(objectClass=groupOfNames)(!(cn=Test Group *))(!(cn=qa)))<br /><br />Filtered-out group does not appear in Groups list<br />Admin syncs LDAP<br /><br />Set filter back to:<br />(&amp;(objectClass=groupOfNames)(!(cn=Test Group *)))</article>

**Expected**

> <article>New user in that group does not join the previously linked team/channel (but does join higher-up groups such as engineering when qa group is filtered out, because they're still in that group in AD/LDAP after all and it's still linked in Mm)<br /><br />Existing user in that group is NOT auto-removed from the previously linked team/channel, and also remains in the &quot;higher-up&quot; groups (because as far as LDAP is concerned, user is still a member of engineering because they are a member of qa which is a member of engineering, even though qa isn't linked)</article>
