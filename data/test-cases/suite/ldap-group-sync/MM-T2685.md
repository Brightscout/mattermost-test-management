## MM-T2685: Chat Facing ➜ Channel ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Channel Members

---

**Step 1**

Chat Facing ➜ Channel ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Channel Members\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Channel, login as a user User1 who has Channel Admin permissions.
2. For the same group synced channel, on a different browser, login as a user User2 who has Channel Admin permissions.
3. As User1, Click on Channel dropdown and select Manage Groups from Channel menu and then set the role to Channel Members for a Group which User2 belongs to.
4. User2 should immediately be updated to Channel Member role and should not be able to perform Channel Admin tasks like view and modify Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User2 still has Channel Member permission for that Team.
