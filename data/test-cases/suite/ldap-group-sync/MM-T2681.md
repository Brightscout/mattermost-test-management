---

**Step 1**

Highest permission should be allotted to user belonging to multiple groups\
————————————————————————————

1. Login as a LDAP user say User1 belonging to 2 groups, group1 and group

2. On a different browser, login as sysadmin and select a team and enable group sync.

3. Add the Groups with Roles as follows:

   - Group1 ➜ Member
   - Group2 ➜ Team Admin

4. Check the role the user User1 has
