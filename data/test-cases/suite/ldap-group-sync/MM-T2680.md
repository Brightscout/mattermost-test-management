## MM-T2680: Team Role ignores Guest Users

---

**Step 1**

Team Role ignores Guest Users\
————————————————————————————

1. Set Guest Filter in LDAP Configuration page such that some users are marked as Guest.
2. Login as LDAP users matching the Guest Filter and ensure that their account is created as a Guest.
3. For a new Group Synced Team, select a Group and set the Role to Team Admin in System Console ➜ Teams page.
4. Check if all users who are not Guest Users have Team Admin permissions for that team.
5. Guest Users should not be added to the team.
