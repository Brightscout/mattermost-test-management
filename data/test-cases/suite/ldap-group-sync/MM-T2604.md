## MM-T2604: User leaves a team manually, then admin links and syncs

---

**Step 1**

User leaves a team manually, then admin links and syncs\
————————————————————————————\
carlos.test leaves newteam2, admin removes newteam2 from abc and adds newteam2 to engineers, syncs\
\
Other user (william.test) newly joins, gets newteam2 from engineer group

1. User leaves a team in main menu ➜ Leave Team
2. Admin links that same team to a(nother?) group the user is in
3. Admin syncs

**Expected**

- User is not re-added to the team after sync
- New user gets the new team on the other group
