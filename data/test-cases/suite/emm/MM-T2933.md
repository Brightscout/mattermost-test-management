## MM-T2933: RN apps: ANDROID ONLY - EMM Android copy-text restriction applies in reply thread as well as center channel

---

**Step 1**

On Android:

1. Uninstall Mattermost
2. Install Test DPC: https\://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc\&hl=en
3. Tap Set Up Test DPC (not just "Test DPC")
4. Set up managed profile > Accept > Add account > Add Google Apps account (use your usual Mattermost one that you use in Play Store, authenticate as needed), Agree to TOS > Finish
5. Tap the Play Store icon that has the briefcase badge (may find it in a separate Work apps list)
6. Search for Mattermost, install
7. Back out of Play Store
8. Tap the Test DPC icon that has the briefcase badge
9. Tap Apps Management > Managed Configurations
10. Select Mattermost from the drop-down list of apps
11. Tap Load Manifest Restrictions
12. Tap pencil icon next to the restriction you want to edit (in this case \`copyAndPasteProtection\`; can test a bunch at once)
13. Delete \`false\` and type \`true\`
14. Save, then Save again
15. From the device's list of apps, find and tap the Mattermost icon that has a briefcase badge
16. Test whether the restriction is enforced (in this case log in, make a post, tap the post to open reply thread, and long-press on the post to open the post action menu)

**Expected**

- \`Copy Post\` option is not available\
  (Also test without the restriction to verify Copy Post is available)

\
**Other verifications**:

- Without PIN on device, \`Blocked... must be secured with a screen lock to use Mattermost\` and a link to \`Go to Settings\`
- With PIN on device, required to enter it when bringing up from background
- Server URL auto-populates and
- Allow other servers = false: auto-progresses to the login credentials screen (no chance to edit)
- Blur protection turns the screen white (obscuring content) when multiple apps/windows being viewed at once (square button)
