- That user should be shown as a Guest User in the Manage Team popup and not as a Team Member.
- Guest dropdown should only show options to Promote to User and Remove from Team.
- Admin should be able to promote a Guest User to a Regular member from the Manage Team popup.
- Admin should be able to remove a team for a Guest User. The logged in Guest user should be automatically redirected to one of the other teams which that guest user has access to.
