## MM-T1388: Enforce Guest MFA when MFA is disabled

---

**Step 1**

Enforce Guest MFA when MFA is disabled\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in as a team admin and navigate to System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ MFA Page
2. Ensure the setting 'Enable Multi factor authentication' is set to false in the MFA page.
3. Now navigate to Guest Access page and check if user is allowed to enforce MFA for Guest
4. Check the helper text displayed when MFA is disabled

**Expected**

- When MFA is disabled, the option enforce MFA for Guest Access should still be disabled in the Guest Access Page.
- A helper text should be displayed indicating "Multi-factor authentication is currently not enabled"
