## MM-T1417: Add Guest User to New Team from System Console

---

**Step 1**

Add Guest User to New Team from System Console\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As a system admin, add a guest user to a new team from User Management ➜ User ➜Add to team.
2. Login as the guest user and navigate to the new team(if your guest is in more than one team)
3. Notice the guest user will be redirected to the channel not found error. A back button should be provided in this error page.
4. When user clicks on the back button link, the guest user should be redirected to the original team/channel to which the user has access to.

**Expected**

- User should be redirected to an error page containing the message "Your guest account has no channels assigned. Please contact an administrator."
- When user clicks on Back button, user should be redirected to the previous team/channel to which the user had access to.
