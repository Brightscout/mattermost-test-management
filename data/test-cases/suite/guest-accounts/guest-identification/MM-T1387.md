## MM-T1387: Whitelisted Guest Domains

---

**Step 1**

Whitelisted Guest Domains\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in as a team admin and navigate to System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Guest Access Page
2. Ensure the setting 'Enable Guest Access' is set to true
3. Specify any one domain in the Whitelisted Guest Domains, for example: mattermost.com
4. Go to System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permission ➜ System Scheme
5. Ensure All Members are able to invite Guests
6. Logout and login as a system user.
7. Click on Invite People from the main menu and select the option to Invite Guests.
8. Enter an email which does not belongs to the whitelisted domain, for example: name\@gmail.com then select a channel and invite them as a guest to a channel

**Expected**

- When a user joins as a Guest with an email address not belonging to one of the whitelisted domains, then an error will appear:
  \
  "_The following email addresses do not belong to an accepted domain: name\@gmail.com. Please contact your System Administrator for details._"
