## MM-T1365: Guest User restricted from creating a direct Message or group Message with unauthorized users via slash command

---

**Step 1**

1. Login as a Guest User and navigate to a channel.
2. Ensure that the guest user does not have access to user1 and user (they don't share any channels with the guest)
3. Issue the following command:
4. /groupmsg @user1,@user2 'message'
5. /msg @user1 'message'

**Expected**

- Group message is not created and a system message is shown:
  \
  "_Unable to find the users: @user1,@user2_"
- Direct message is not created and a system message is shown:
  \
  "_Unable to find the users: @user1_"
