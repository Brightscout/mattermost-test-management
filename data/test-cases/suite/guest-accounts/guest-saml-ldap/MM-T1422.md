## MM-T1422: LDAP Guest Filter

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure LDAP setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Navigate to System Console > AD/LDAP and set Guest Filter to "(uid=test.11)"
3. Now login as a user "test.11" and check if user is logged in as a Guest User and by default has access to no teams and channels.
4. Login as any other LDAP user, say "test.12" and check if that user is logged in as Member.
5. Remove the Guest Filter from the System Console and save.
6. Now login again as "test.11".
