## MM-T1426: SAML Guest Attribute change

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure SAML setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Ensure Guest Access is turned on in System Console > Guest Access.
3. Navigate to System Console > SAML and set Guest Attribute to "isGuest=TEST".

_Related ticket(s):_

[Guest Filter and Guest Attributes should be disabled/hidden in the LDAP and SAML settings when Guest Access is disabled â€” MM-20866](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-20866)

**Expected**

- User should be logged in as a Member.

---

**Step 2**

1. Now on a new browser login with a user who has isGuest=true. User would be logged in as Member.
2. Navigate to System Console > SAML and set Guest Attribute to "isGuest=TRUE".
3. Revoke session of all users and ensure the user in step 4 logs in again.
4. Next time the user logs in, the user should be converted to a Guest user.

**Expected**

- User would be demoted to a Guest user. Whatever teams the user had access to those should be retained and guest user should have access to the default channels in those teams.
