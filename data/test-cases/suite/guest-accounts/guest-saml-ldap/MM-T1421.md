## MM-T1421: Change/Remove SAML Guest Attribute

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure SAML setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Navigate to System Console > SAML 2.0 and set Guest Attribute to "isGuest=true"
3. Login as a SAML user who has this attribute "isGuest=true" configured in the SAML Server
4. Now login as sysadmin and remove the Guest Attribute and check

**Expected**

- Existing guest users should not be promoted to members.
- Any new user who tries to login with isGuest=true will no longer be considered a Guest user and instead should be considered a regular member
