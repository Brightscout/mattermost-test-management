## MM-T1424: LDAP Guest Filter behavior when Guest Access is disabled

---

**Step 1**

1\. Option to set Guest Filter should be disabled\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Ensure LDAP setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Ensure Guest Access is turned on in System Console > Guest Access.
3. Navigate to System Console > AD/LDAP and set Guest Filter to "(uid=test.14)".
4. Now navigate to System Console > Guest Access and disable the Guest Access.
5. Check if the option to set Guest Filter is also disabled in System Console > AD/LDAP page

2\. Login as a new LDAP user "test.14" and check if user is allowed to be logged in as a regular member.

**Expected**

1. Option to set Guest Filter should be disabled in AD/LDAP page when Guest Access is disabled.
2. New LDAP user test.14 should be logged in and should be considered as a regular member and should be allowed to access the rest of the application.
