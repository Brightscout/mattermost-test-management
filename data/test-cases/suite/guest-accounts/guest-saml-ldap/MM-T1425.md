## MM-T1425: LDAP Guest Filter Change

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure LDAP setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Ensure Guest Access is turned on in System Console > Guest Access.
3. Now on a new browser login as test.1User would be logged in as Member.

**Expected**

- Test.15 user should be logged in as a Member.

---

**Step 2**

1. Navigate to System Console > AD/LDAP and set Guest Filter to "(uid=test.15)".
2. Revoke session of test.15 user and ensure the user logs in again.
3. Next time test.15 user logs in, the user should be converted to a Guest user.

**Expected**

- Test.15 user would be demoted to a Guest user. Whatever teams the user had access to those should be retained and guest user should have access to the default channels in those teams.
