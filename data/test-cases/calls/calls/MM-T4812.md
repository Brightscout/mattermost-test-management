## MM-T4812: Cloud Call Limits

---

**Step 1**

Create 2 of your own users on the test server - UserA + UserB.\
\
To generate extra simulated users and easily reach the limits - checkout the \`lt\` branch of \`mattermost-plugin-calls\` and run\
\
\`go run ./lt/client.go -url '${URL}' -team ${TEAM\_ID} -admin-password Sys\@dmin123 -users-per-call 7 -join-duration 1s -duration 60s\`\
\
when the call limit is reached on Professional & Enterprise, the join banner should be hidden, the header and custom post join buttons are disabled, and \`/call join\` does not join.\
\
\
\*\*On-Prem\*\*\
\- channels - can start and join calls, no user limit\
\- DM - can start and join calls\
\- GM - can start and join calls\
\
\*\*Starter\*\*\
\- channels - cannot start call\
\- DM - can start and join calls\
\- GM - cannot start call\
\
\*\*Professional\*\*\
\- channels - start a call with 7 users using the load test command -> join call with UserA -> verify that UserB cannot join and see the appropriate UI changes -> leave with UserA -> verify that UserB can now join\
\- DM - can start and join calls\
\- GM - can start and join calls\
\
\*\*Enterprise\*\*:\
\- channels - start a call with 7 users using the load test command -> join call with UserA -> verify that UserB cannot join and see the appropriate UI changes -> leave with UserA -> verify that UserB can now join\
\- DM - can start and join calls\
\- GM -can start and join calls
