## MM-T696: Can't delete other user's slash command

---

**Step 1**

Can't delete other user's slash command\
\--------------------\
In System Console > Integrations, ensure Restrict managing integrations to Admins\* is set to false\
1\. With a non-admin account, Open Main Menu > Integrations > Slash Commands.\
2\. Find a slash command you DID NOT create\
3\. Check that Edit and Delete options do not show up

**Expected**

Edit and Delete do not show up for non-admins, since they did not create the command.
