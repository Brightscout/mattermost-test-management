## MM-T2494: Correct error messages displayed if empty form is submitted

---

**Step 1**

Correct error messages displayed if empty form is submitted\
————————————————————————————

1. In a message input box (center channel or RHS), type "/dialog" and hit "Enter"
2. Click/tap the "Submit" button

**Expected**

- Interactive dialog modal opens and ephemeral post confirming you used the slash command to open the dialog is made
- For any field that has a red asterisk to the right of it's name (i.e. required)
- You should see a red error message, positioned below the help text (or just below the input box if there is no help text for that field) saying "This field is required"
- The error message should be left-aligned (in line with input box and help text)
