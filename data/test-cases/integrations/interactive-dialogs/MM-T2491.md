[Webapp: interactive dialog does not open via slash command/webhook — MM-18340](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18340)

**Expected**

- Interactive dialog modal opens

- Ephemeral post (in center channel or RHS depending where you used the slash command from) confirming you used the slash command to open the dialog

- Check the following:

  - Across the top of the screen :
  - Logo, dialog name and an "X" to close the dialog
  - Scrollbar down the right can scroll to the bottom of the dialog screen
  - Option selection box titles, input text/selection box and help text are all left-aligned
  - "Cancel" and "Submit" buttons are right-aligned in the footer of the screen
