## MM-T706: Error Handling for Slash Commands

---

**Step 1**

Error Handling for Slash Commands\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Test Setup**:

1. Get the channel ID of the off-topic channel
2. Add a slash command with any trigger word (could be "error\_handling") with request URL of "https\://slash-url-error-handling-7zcjp6ud59wg.runkit.sh?type=system\_message\&channel\_id=**\[**enter channel ID**]**" and request method of "POST"
3. If request URL is not available, see <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-qa-automation/tree/master/server/release_test_slash> on how to run/deploy.
4. On success, go to a different channel and post a slash command ("/error\_handling")

**Expected**

- 1 message ("Hello World") being posted in off-topic
- 1 message failing to be posted, since \`type\` is \`system\_message\`
- Error message "Command 'error\_handling' failed to post response. Please contact your System Administrator." being shown to user
