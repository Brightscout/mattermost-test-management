---

**Step 1**

1\. In a private channel where only you are a member post @extteam

**Expected**

1\. Link is rendred as "@extteam".\
2\. You receive an ephemeral message saying "@Christopher Speller and @Dylan Haussermann were mentioned but they are not in the channel. Would you like to add them to this private channel? They will have access to all message history."
