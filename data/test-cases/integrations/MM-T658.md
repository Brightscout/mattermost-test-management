- [Deactivated user can be added or removed from a channel via '/invite', '/kick' and '/remove' commands — MM-12110](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-12110)

**Expected**

- User who added them sees system message "username added to the channel by Firstname Lastname."
- Added user sees channel added to LHS, mention badge, system message "username added to the channel by username."
- Cannot invite deactivated users to a channel (e.g. 'lindyda2' on community-release.mattermost.com)
