## MM-T687: /msg

---

**Step 1**

/msg\
\--------------------\
Test on user on multiple teams\
1\. Go to Town Square\
2\. Type /msg followed by a username and a message, then post

**Expected**

Direct Message channel opens with that user in the same browser tab, and no system message is posted to Town Square\
\
User is not switched to different team
