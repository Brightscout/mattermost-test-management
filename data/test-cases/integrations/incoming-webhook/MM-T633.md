â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\\

1. In Postman, send a POST to URL https\://community-release.mattermost.com/hooks/szkru7tukfy9zc6duoof4pjooh with body containing the attached payload
2. Search for `findme`

(**Story**) [Search bodies of Slack Attachments on Messages â€” MM-10977](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10977)

_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**:

- This will only work on an elasticsearch enabled instance so test this on [community-release.mattermost.com](https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/qa-private) where the incoming webhook is already set up

**Test Data**

{"attachments": \[{"type": "slack\_attachment", "color": "#7CD197", "fields": \[{"short": false, "title": "Area", "value": "This is a test post from the Integrations tab of release testing that will be deleted by someone who has the admin level permissions to do so."}], "text": "This is the text of the attachment. This text should be searchable. Findme.", "title": "Title"}]}

**Expected**

- The Slack attachment webhook post you just made is returned in search results
