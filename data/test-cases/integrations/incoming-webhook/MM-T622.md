## MM-T622: Disallow override of username and profile picture

---

**Step 1**

Incoming Webhooks — Disallow override of username and profile picture\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Disallow override of username and profile pic in [the System Console](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/admin_console/integrations/integration_management) (set both to 'False') and save
2. Send from Postman again

\
**Tip**: If you have the settings page and the channel where you've been testing incoming webhooks in view at the same time you can see the changes take place without having to send from postman again.

**Test Data**
