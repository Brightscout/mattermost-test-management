- Profile picture shows as what is in the payload in Postman (Mattermost logo![](https://smartbear-tm4j-prod-us-west-2-attachment-rich-text.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1578947318269-1578947318268.png)image, same as before as it ignores the webhook settings and overrides them with the payload data)
- There should be no status indicator for the bot
- Clicking both the username and the profile image will show the profile popover
- BOT label is next to the user's name instead of below the profile image
- \- Formatted as described in post - Pop-Over matches profile image and user name supplied. And the pop-over shows a footer of \`this post was created by an integration from @\<user who made the webhook>
