â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“

1. Replace the existing payload text with one of the payloads shown in the test data field
2. Send it

**Test Data**

**Payload will land in channel as defined in webhook on Mattermost**:\
{"attachments":\[{"fallback": "fallback text", "image\_url":"https\://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/10/10/22/24/wide-format-2839089\_960\_720.jpg"}]}\
\
â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\
\
**Payload will land in channel specified (and username, etc.) as defined in the payload below**:\
{"channel": "off-topic", "username": "new\_username", "attachments":\[{"fallback": "fallback text", "image\_url":"https\://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/10/10/22/24/wide-format-2839089\_960\_720.jpg"}], "icon\_url": "http\://www\.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon\_WS.png"}

**Expected**

- Webapp and RN show the image correctly
- Fallback text should not be visible
- There is no extra white space in the attachment when the attachment has no title
