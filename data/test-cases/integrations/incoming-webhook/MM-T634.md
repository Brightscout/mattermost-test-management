**Step 1**

Incoming webhook - Action buttons in Slack-style attachment post\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In Postman, send a POST containing the attached payload (on any server/channel)
2. On both desktop/browser and RN apps, click/tap the action buttons in the post and make selections

**Test Data**

"attachments": \[\
{\
"pretext": "This is the attachment pretext.",\
"text": "This is the attachment text.",\
"actions": \[\
{\
"name": "Select an option...",\
"integration": {\
"url": "http\://127.0.0.1:7357/action\_options",\
"context": {\
"action": "do\_something"\
}\
},\
"type": "select",\

"context": {\
"action": "do\_something\_update"\
}\
}\
}\
]\
}\
]\
}

**Expected**

- The first two elements are drop-down menus, the second two are buttons (note: they might not really do anything, but should at least appear to behave as drop-downs and buttons)
