2. Copy "https\://outgoing-webhook-01snptsk6qvz.runkit.sh/" as callback URL or setup one if not available (see "<https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-qa-automation/tree/master/server/release_test_webhook>")

3. Set up outgoing webhook in Mattermost ➜ Integrations

   - Title / description anything you like, leave content type as-is
   - Select a channel from the drop-down
   - Leave trigger words blank
   - Paste the URL from step 2 in the Callback URLs field

- In the Mattermost channel, both users see a post like the following, where the username = webhook, and the profile pic is the webhook icon seen in the test data column to the left
