## MM-T581: Regenerate token produces new token and slash command still works

---

**Step 1**

Regen token\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Open Main Menu ➜ Integrations ➜ Slash Commands
2. Click "Regenerate Token" next to a slash command (can use the one created in a previous test)\

3. Close Integrations and re-open to verify the Token update saved
4. In a test channel, trigger the slash command

**Expected**

- Updated token saves on close and re-open of settings
- Posting slash command still works as expected
