## MM-T3451: BOT Profile looks correct for ephemeral posts

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable a plugin with a bot that will make ephemeral posts (I used GitHub)\
2\. Type _/github me_ in the main thread\
3\. Type _/github me_ in the RHS thread

**Expected**

On 2. Ephemeral post made by GitHub is shown with correct profile and username\
On 3. Ephemeral post made by GitHub is shown with correct profile and username
