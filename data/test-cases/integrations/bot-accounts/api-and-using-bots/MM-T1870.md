–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create or locate a bot account that has a system admin role
2. Using a curl command similar to what's shown in tests data, post as the target bot in a channel where the bot is a member

**Test Data**

curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"channel\_id":"\<ChannelID>", "message":"This is a message from a bot", "props":{"attachments": \[{"pretext": "Look some text","text": "This is text"}]}}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer \<Auth Token of creator>' https\://\<serveraddress>/api/v4/posts

**Expected**

- Post is successful
