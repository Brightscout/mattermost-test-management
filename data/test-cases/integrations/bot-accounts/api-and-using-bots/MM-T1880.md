## MM-T1880: Deleted token can not be used to post

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create or locate a bot that you have a valid token\
2\. Tests that the BOT can successfully post to a channel without issue (see test data)\
3\. Delete the token being used\
4\. Attempt the same post again

**Test Data**

curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"channel\_id":"\<ChannelID>", "message":"This is a message from a bot", "props":{"attachments": \[{"pretext": "Look some text","text": "This is text"}]}}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer \<Auth Token of creator>' https\://\<serveraddress>/api/v4/posts

**Expected**

Post fails
