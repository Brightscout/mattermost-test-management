## MM-T5161: Delete a Subscription

---

**Step 1**

1\. Type /figma list command\
2\. Press the delete button on any subscription

**Expected**

Type /figma list again, and you should not see a deleted subscription. Now when you type /figma\
you should only see connect command (and configure command if you are the server admin)
