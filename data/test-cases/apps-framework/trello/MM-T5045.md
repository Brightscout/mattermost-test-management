12\. Execute action

On 7. A new post (card creation) will be shown on the subscribed channel\
On 8. Nothing will be shown on any channel\
On 9. A new post will be shown on the subscribed channel\
On 12. The data is validated. `Trello` app bot sends response to confirm or to show error

---

**Step 3**

13\. Run `/trello card create`. The card's board should be the same as the one subscribed\
14\. Subscribe to multiple boards on the same channel using `/trello subscription add` and perform an action on each one

On 14. You should get notifications from all the boards subscribed to
